<head>Definition Of Poetry.</head>

<p>
Poetry is not the proper antithesis to prose,
but to science. Poetry is opposed to science,
and prose to metre. The proper and immediate
object of science is the acquirement, or communication,
of truth; the proper and immediate object
of poetry is the communication of immediate pleasure.
This definition is useful; but as it would
include novels and other works of fiction, which
yet we do not call poems, there must be some
additional character by which poetry is not only
divided from opposites, but likewise distinguished
from disparate, though similar, modes of composition.
Now how is this to be effected? In animated
prose, the beauties of nature, and the passions and
accidents of human nature, are often expressed in
that natural language which the contemplation of
them would suggest to a pure and benevolent
mind; yet still neither we nor the writers call such
a work a poem, though no work could deserve that
name which did not include all this, together with
something else. What is this? It is that pleasurable
emotion, that peculiar state and degree of
excitement, which arises in the poet himself in the
act of composition;&mdash;and in order to understand
this, we must combine a more than ordinary sympathy
<pb n='002'/><anchor id='Pg002'/>
with the objects, emotions, or incidents contemplated
by the poet, consequent on a more than
common sensibility, with a more than ordinary
activity of the mind in respect of the fancy and
the imagination. Hence is produced a more vivid
reflection of the truths of nature and of the human
heart, united with a constant activity modifying
and correcting these truths by that sort of pleasurable
emotion, which the exertion of all our faculties
gives in a certain degree; but which can only
be felt in perfection under the full play of those
powers of mind, which are spontaneous rather than
voluntary, and in which the effort required bears
no proportion to the activity enjoyed. This is the
state which permits the production of a highly
pleasurable whole, of which each part shall also
communicate for itself a distinct and conscious
pleasure; and hence arises the definition, which I
trust is now intelligible, that poetry, or rather a
poem, is a species of composition, opposed to
science, as having intellectual pleasure for its
object, and as attaining its end by the use of
language natural to us in a state of excitement,&mdash;but
distinguished from other species of composition,
not excluded by the former criterion, by
permitting a pleasure from the whole consistent
with a consciousness of pleasure from the component
parts;&mdash;and the perfection of which is, to
communicate from each part the greatest immediate
pleasure compatible with the largest sum
of pleasure on the whole. This, of course, will
vary with the different modes of poetry;&mdash;and
that splendour of particular lines, which would
be worthy of admiration in an impassioned elegy,
or a short indignant satire, would be a blemish
<pb n='003'/><anchor id='Pg003'/>
and proof of vile taste in a tragedy or an epic
poem.
</p>

<p>
It is remarkable, by the way, that Milton in
three incidental words has implied all which for
the purposes of more distinct apprehension, which
at first must be slow-paced in order to be distinct,
I have endeavoured to develope in a precise and
strictly adequate definition. Speaking of poetry,
he says, as in a parenthesis, <q>which is simple,
sensuous, passionate.</q> How awful is the power of
words!&mdash;fearful often in their consequences when
merely felt, not understood; but most awful when
both felt and understood!&mdash;Had these three words
only been properly understood by, and present in
the minds of, general readers, not only almost
a library of false poetry would have been either
precluded or still-born, but, what is of more consequence,
works truly excellent and capable of
enlarging the understanding, warming and purifying
the heart, and placing in the centre of the
whole being the germs of noble and manlike
actions, would have been the common diet of the
intellect instead. For the first condition, simplicity,&mdash;while,
on the one hand, it distinguishes
poetry from the arduous processes of science,
labouring towards an end not yet arrived at, and
supposes a smooth and finished road, on which the
reader is to walk onward easily, with streams murmuring
by his side, and trees and flowers and
human dwellings to make his journey as delightful
as the object of it is desirable, instead of
having to toil with the pioneers and painfully
make the road on which others are to travel,&mdash;precludes,
on the other hand, every affectation and
morbid peculiarity;&mdash;the second condition, sensuousness,
<pb n='004'/><anchor id='Pg004'/>
insures that framework of objectivity,
that definiteness and articulation of imagery, and
that modification of the images themselves, without
which poetry becomes flattened into mere
didactics of practice, or evaporated into a hazy,
unthoughtful, day-dreaming; and the third condition,
passion, provides that neither thought nor
imagery shall be simply objective, but that the
<foreign lang="it" rend="font-style: italic">passio vera</foreign>
of humanity shall warm and animate both.
</p>

<p>
To return, however, to the previous definition,
this most general and distinctive character of a
poem originates in the poetic genius itself; and
though it comprises whatever can with any propriety
be called a poem (unless that word be a
mere lazy synonym for a composition in metre),
it yet becomes a just, and not merely discriminative,
but full and adequate, definition of poetry in
its highest and most peculiar sense, only so far
as the distinction still results from the poetic
genius, which sustains and modifies the emotions,
thoughts, and vivid representations of the poem
by the energy without effort of the poet's own
mind,&mdash;by the spontaneous activity of his imagination
and fancy, and by whatever else with
these reveals itself in the balancing and reconciling
of opposite or discordant qualities, sameness
with difference, a sense of novelty and freshness
with old or customary objects, a more than usual
state of emotion with more than usual order, self-possession
and judgment with enthusiasm and
vehement feeling,&mdash;and which, while it blends
and harmonizes the natural and the artificial, still
subordinates art to nature, the manner to the
matter, and our admiration of the poet to our
<pb n='005'/><anchor id='Pg005'/>
sympathy with the images, passions, characters,
and incidents of the poem:&mdash;

<head>Greek Drama.</head>

<p>
It is truly singular that Plato,&mdash;whose philosophy
and religion were but exotic at home,
and a mere opposition to the finite in all things,
genuine prophet and anticipator as he was of the
Protestant Christian æra,&mdash;should have given in
his Dialogue of the Banquet, a justification of
our Shakespeare. For he relates that, when all
the other guests had either dispersed or fallen
asleep, Socrates only, together with Aristophanes
and Agathon, remained awake, and that, while he
continued to drink with them out of a large goblet,
he compelled them, though most reluctantly, to
admit that it was the business of one and the same
genius to excel in tragic and comic poetry, or that
the tragic poet ought, at the same time, to contain
within himself the powers of comedy. Now, as
this was directly repugnant to the entire theory of
the ancient critics, and contrary to all their experience,
it is evident that Plato must have fixed the
eye of his contemplation on the innermost essentials
of the drama, abstracted from the forms of
age or country. In another passage he even adds
the reason, namely, that opposites illustrate each
other's nature, and in their struggle draw forth
the strength of the combatants, and display the
conqueror as sovereign even on the territories of
the rival power.
</p>

<p>
Nothing can more forcibly exemplify the separative
spirit of the Greek arts than their comedy as
opposed to their tragedy. But as the immediate
<pb n='008'/><anchor id='Pg008'/>
struggle of contraries supposes an arena common
to both, so both were alike ideal; that is, the
comedy of Aristophanes rose to as great a distance
above the ludicrous of real life, as the tragedy of
Sophocles above its tragic events and passions,&mdash;and
it is in this one point, of absolute ideality,
that the comedy of Shakespeare and the old comedy
of Athens coincide. In this also alone did the
Greek tragedy and comedy unite; in every thing
else they were exactly opposed to each other.
Tragedy is poetry in its deepest earnest; comedy
is poetry in unlimited jest. Earnestness consists
in the direction and convergence of all the powers
of the soul to one aim, and in the voluntary restraint
of its activity in consequence; the opposite,
therefore, lies in the apparent abandonment of all
definite aim or end, and in the removal of all
bounds in the exercise of the mind,&mdash;attaining its
real end, as an entire contrast, most perfectly, the
greater the display is of intellectual wealth squandered
in the wantonness of sport without an object,
and the more abundant the life and vivacity in the
creations of the arbitrary will.
</p>

<p>
The later comedy, even where it was really
comic, was doubtless likewise more comic, the more
free it appeared from any fixed aim. Misunderstandings
of intention, fruitless struggles of absurd
passion, contradictions of temper, and laughable
situations there were; but still the form of the representation
itself was serious; it proceeded as
much according to settled laws, and used as much
the same means of art, though to a different purpose,
as the regular tragedy itself. But in the old
comedy the very form itself is whimsical; the
whole work is one great jest, comprehending a
<pb n='009'/><anchor id='Pg009'/>
world of jests within it, among which each maintains
its own place without seeming to concern
itself as to the relation in which it may stand to its
fellows. In short, in Sophocles, the constitution of
tragedy is monarchical, but such as it existed in
elder Greece, limited by laws, and therefore the
more venerable,&mdash;all the parts adapting and submitting
themselves to the majesty of the heroic
sceptre:&mdash;in Aristophanes, comedy, on the contrary,
is poetry in its most democratic form, and it
is a fundamental principle with it, rather to risk all
the confusion of anarchy, than to destroy the
independence and privileges of its individual constituents,&mdash;place,
verse, characters, even single
thoughts, conceits, and allusions, each turning on
the pivot of its own free will.
</p>

<p>
The tragic poet idealizes his characters by giving
to the spiritual part of our nature a more decided
preponderance over the animal cravings and impulses,
than is met with in real life: the comic
poet idealizes his characters by making the animal
the governing power, and the intellectual the mere
instrument. But as tragedy is not a collection of
virtues and perfections, but takes care only that
the vices and imperfections shall spring from the
passions, errors, and prejudices which arise out of
the soul;&mdash;so neither is comedy a mere crowd of
vices and follies, but whatever qualities it represents,
even though they are in a certain sense
amiable, it still displays them as having their origin
in some dependence on our lower nature, accompanied
with a defect in true freedom of spirit and
self-subsistence, and subject to that unconnection
by contradictions of the inward being, to which
all folly is owing.
</p>

<pb n='010'/><anchor id='Pg010'/>

<p>
The ideal of earnest poetry consists in the union
and harmonious melting down, and fusion of the
sensual into the spiritual,&mdash;of man as an animal
into man as a power of reason and self-government.
And this we have represented to us most
clearly in the plastic art, or statuary; where the
perfection of outward form is a symbol of the perfection
of an inward idea; where the body is
wholly penetrated by the soul, and spiritualized
even to a state of glory, and like a transparent
substance, the matter, in its own nature darkness,
becomes altogether a vehicle and fixture of light, a
means of developing its beauties, and unfolding its
wealth of various colours without disturbing its
unity, or causing a division of the parts. The
sportive ideal, on the contrary, consists in the perfect
harmony and concord of the higher nature
with the animal, as with its ruling principle and its
acknowledged regent. The understanding and
practical reason are represented as the willing
slaves of the senses and appetites, and of the passions
arising out of them. Hence we may admit
the appropriateness to the old comedy, as a work
of defined art, of allusions and descriptions, which
morality can never justify, and, only with reference
to the author himself, and only as being the effect
or rather the cause of the circumstances in which
he wrote, can consent even to palliate.
</p>

<p>
The old comedy rose to its perfection in Aristophanes,
and in him also it died with the freedom of
Greece. Then arose a species of drama, more fitly
called dramatic entertainment than comedy, but of
which, nevertheless, our modern comedy (Shakespeare's
altogether excepted) is the genuine descendant.
Euripides had already brought tragedy lower
<pb n='011'/><anchor id='Pg011'/>
down and by many steps nearer to the real world
than his predecessors had ever done, and the passionate
admiration which Menander and Philemon
expressed for him, and their open avowals that he
was their great master, entitle us to consider their
dramas as of a middle species, between tragedy and
comedy,&mdash;not the tragi-comedy, or thing of heterogeneous
parts, but a complete whole, founded on
principles of its own. Throughout we find the
drama of Menander distinguishing itself from tragedy,
but not as the genuine old comedy, contrasting
with, and opposing it. Tragedy, indeed, carried
the thoughts into the mythologic world, in order
to raise the emotions, the fears, and the hopes,
which convince the inmost heart that their final
cause is not to be discovered in the limits of mere
mortal life, and force us into a presentiment, however
dim, of a state in which those struggles of inward
free will with outward necessity, which form
the true subject of the tragedian, shall be reconciled
and solved;&mdash;the entertainment or new comedy,
on the other hand, remained within the circle of
experience. Instead of the tragic destiny, it introduced
the power of chance; even in the few fragments
of Menander and Philemon now remaining
to us, we find many exclamations and reflections
concerning chance and fortune, as in the tragic
poets concerning destiny. In tragedy, the moral
law, either as obeyed or violated, above all consequences&mdash;its
own maintenance or violation
constituting the most important of all consequences&mdash;forms
the ground; the new comedy,
and our modern comedy in general (Shakespeare
excepted as before) lies in prudence or imprudence,
enlightened or misled self-love. The whole moral
<pb n='012'/><anchor id='Pg012'/>
system of the entertainment exactly like that of
fable, consists in rules of prudence, with an exquisite
conciseness, and at the same time an
exhaustive fulness of sense. An old critic said
that tragedy was the flight or elevation of life,
comedy (that of Menander) its arrangement or
ordonnance.
</p>

<p>
Add to these features a portrait-like truth of
character,&mdash;not so far indeed as that a <hi rend='italic'>bona fide</hi>
individual should be described or imagined, but yet
so that the features which give interest and permanence
to the class should be individualized. The old
tragedy moved in an ideal world,&mdash;the old comedy
in a fantastic world. As the entertainment, or new
comedy, restrained the creative activity both of
the fancy and the imagination, it indemnified the
understanding in appealing to the judgment for the
probability of the scenes represented. The ancients
themselves acknowledged the new comedy as an
exact copy of real life. The grammarian, Aristophanes,
somewhat affectedly exclaimed:&mdash;<q>O Life
and Menander! which of you two imitated the
other?</q> In short the form of this species of drama
was poetry, the stuff or matter was prose. It was
prose rendered delightful by the blandishments
and measured motions of the muse. Yet even this
was not universal. The mimes of Sophron, so
passionately admired by Plato, were written in
prose, and were scenes out of real life conducted
in dialogue. The exquisite feast of Adonis
(Συρακούσιαι ῆ Ἀδωνιάζουσαι) in Theocritus, we are
told, with some others of his eclogues, were close
imitations of certain mimes of Sophron&mdash;free translations
of the prose into hexameters.
</p>

<p>
It will not be improper, in this place, to make a
<pb n='013'/><anchor id='Pg013'/>
few remarks on the remarkable character and functions
of the chorus in the Greek tragic drama.
</p>

<p>
The chorus entered from below, close by the
orchestra, and there, pacing to and fro during the
choral odes, performed their solemn measured
dance. In the centre of the <hi rend='italic'>orchestra</hi>, directly
over against the middle of the <hi rend='italic'>scene</hi>, there stood an
elevation with steps in the shape of a large altar,
as high as the boards of the <hi rend='italic'>logeion</hi> or moveable
stage. This elevation was named the <hi rend='italic'>thymele</hi>
(θυμέλη), and served to recall the origin and original
purpose of the chorus, as an altar-song in honour
of the presiding deity. Here, and on these steps
the persons of the chorus sate collectively, when
they were not singing; attending to the dialogue
as spectators, and acting as (what in truth they
were) the ideal representatives of the real audience,
and of the poet himself in his own character,
assuming the supposed impressions made by the
drama, in order to direct and rule them. But when
the chorus itself formed part of the dialogue, then
the leader of the band, the foreman, or <hi rend='italic'>coryphæus</hi>,
ascended, as some think, the level summit of the
<hi rend='italic'>thymele</hi> in order to command the stage, or, perhaps,
the whole chorus advanced to the front of the orchestra,
and thus put themselves in ideal connection,
as it were, with the <hi rend='italic'>dramatis personæ</hi> there acting.
This <hi rend='italic'>thymele</hi> was in the centre of the whole edifice,
all the measurements were calculated, and the semi-circle
of the amphitheatre was drawn from this
point. It had a double use, a twofold purpose; it
constantly reminded the spectators of the origin of
tragedy as a religious service, and declared itself
as the ideal representative of the audience by
having its place exactly in the point, to which all
<pb n='014'/><anchor id='Pg014'/>
the radii from the different seats or benches converged.
</p>

<p>
In this double character, as constituent parts,
and yet at the same time as spectators, of the drama,
the chorus could not but tend to enforce the unity
of place;&mdash;not on the score of any supposed improbability,
which the understanding or common sense
might detect in a change of place;&mdash;but because the
senses themselves put it out of the power of any
imagination to conceive a place coming to, and
going away from the persons, instead of the persons
changing their place. Yet there are instances,
in which, during the silence of the chorus, the poets
have hazarded this by a change in that part of the
scenery which represented the more distant objects
to the eye of the spectator&mdash;a demonstrative proof,
that this alternately extolled and ridiculed unity
(as ignorantly ridiculed as extolled) was grounded
on no essential principle of reason, but arose out of
circumstances which the poet could not remove,
and therefore took up into the form of the drama,
and co-organised it with all the other parts into a
living whole.
</p>

<p>
The Greek tragedy may rather be compared to
our serious opera than to the tragedies of Shakespeare;
nevertheless, the difference is far greater
than the likeness. In the opera all is subordinated
to the music, the dresses, and the scenery;&mdash;the
poetry is a mere vehicle for articulation, and as
little pleasure is lost by ignorance of the Italian
language, so is little gained by the knowledge of it.
But in the Greek drama all was but as instruments
and accessaries to the poetry; and hence we should
form a better notion of the choral music from the
solemn hymns and psalms of austere church music
<pb n='015'/><anchor id='Pg015'/>
than from any species of theatrical singing. A
single flute or pipe was the ordinary accompaniment;
and it is not to be supposed, that any display
of musical power was allowed to obscure the distinct
hearing of the words. On the contrary, the
evident purpose was to render the words more
audible, and to secure by the elevations and pauses
greater facility of understanding the poetry. For
the choral songs are, and ever must have been, the
most difficult part of the tragedy; there occur in
them the most involved verbal compounds, the
newest expressions, the boldest images, the most
recondite allusions. Is it credible that the poets
would, one and all, have been thus prodigal of the
stores of art and genius, if they had known that in
the representation the whole must have been lost
to the audience,&mdash;at a time too, when the means of
after publication were so difficult and expensive,
and the copies of their works so slowly and narrowly
circulated?
</p>

<p>
The masks also must be considered&mdash;their vast
variety and admirable workmanship. Of this we
retain proof by the marble masks which represented
them; but to this in the real mask we must add the
thinness of the substance and the exquisite fitting
on to the head of the actor; so that not only were
the very eyes painted with a single opening left for
the pupil of the actor's eye, but in some instances,
even the iris itself was painted, when the colour
was a known characteristic of the divine or heroic
personage represented.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I will note down those fundamental
characteristics which contradistinguish the ancient
literature from the modern generally, but which
more especially appear in prominence in the tragic
<pb n='016'/><anchor id='Pg016'/>
drama. The ancient was allied to statuary, the
modern refers to painting. In the first there is a
predominance of rhythm and melody, in the second
of harmony and counterpoint. The Greeks idolized
the finite, and therefore were the masters of all grace,
elegance, proportion, fancy, dignity, majesty&mdash;of
whatever, in short, is capable of being definitely
conveyed by defined forms or thoughts: the moderns
revere the infinite, and affect the indefinite as a
vehicle of the infinite;&mdash;hence their passions, their
obscure hopes and fears, their wandering through
the unknown, their grander moral feelings, their
more august conception of man as man, their
future rather than their past&mdash;in a word, their
sublimity.

<head>Progress Of The Drama.</head>

<p>
Let two persons join in the same scheme to
ridicule a third, and either take advantage of,
or invent, some story for that purpose, and mimicry
will have already produced a sort of rude comedy.
It becomes an inviting treat to the populace, and
gains an additional zest and burlesque by following
the already established plan of tragedy; and the
first man of genius who seizes the idea, and reduces
it into form,&mdash;into a work of art,&mdash;by metre and
music, is the Aristophanes of the country.
</p>

<p>
How just this account is will appear from the
fact that in the first or old comedy of the Athenians,
most of the <hi rend='italic'>dramatis personæ</hi> were living characters
introduced under their own names; and no doubt,
their ordinary dress, manner, person and voice
were closely mimicked. In less favourable states
of society, as that of England in the middle ages,
the beginnings of comedy would be constantly
taking place from the mimics and satirical minstrels;
but from want of fixed abode, popular government,
and the successive attendance of the same auditors,
it would still remain in embryo. I shall, perhaps,
have occasion to observe that this remark is not
without importance in explaining the essential
differences of the modern and ancient theatres.
</p>

<p>
Phenomena, similar to those which accompanied
the origin of tragedy and comedy among the
Greeks, would take place among the Romans much
more slowly, and the drama would, in any case,
<pb n='018'/><anchor id='Pg018'/>
have much longer remained in its first irregular
form from the character of the people, their continual
engagements in wars of conquest, the nature
of their government, and their rapidly increasing
empire. But, however this might have been, the
conquest of Greece precluded both the process and
the necessity of it; and the Roman stage at once
presented imitations or translations of the Greek
drama. This continued till the perfect establishment
of Christianity. Some attempts, indeed, were
made to adapt the persons of Scriptural or ecclesiastical
history to the drama; and sacred plays, it
is probable, were not unknown in Constantinople
under the emperors of the East. The first of the
kind is, I believe, the only one preserved,&mdash;namely,
the Χριστὸς Πάσχων, or, <q>Christ in his sufferings,</q>
by Gregory Nazianzen,&mdash;possibly written in
consequence of the prohibition of profane literature
to the Christians by the apostate Julian. In the
West, however, the enslaved and debauched Roman
world became too barbarous for any theatrical
exhibitions more refined than those of pageants
and chariot-races; while the spirit of Christianity,
which in its most corrupt form still breathed general
humanity, whenever controversies of faith were
not concerned, had done away the cruel combats
of the gladiators, and the loss of the distant provinces
prevented the possibility of exhibiting the
engagements of wild beasts.
</p>

<p>
I pass, therefore, at once to the feudal ages
which soon succeeded, confining my observation to
this country; though, indeed, the same remark
with very few alterations will apply to all the
other states, into which the great empire was
broken. Ages of darkness succeeded;&mdash;not, indeed,
<pb n='019'/><anchor id='Pg019'/>
the darkness of Russia or of the barbarous
lands unconquered by Rome; for from the time
of Honorius to the destruction of Constantinople
and the consequent introduction of ancient literature
into Europe, there was a continued succession
of individual intellects;&mdash;the golden chain was
never wholly broken, though the connecting links
were often of baser metal. A dark cloud, like
another sky, covered the entire cope of heaven,&mdash;but
in this place it thinned away, and white stains
of light showed a half eclipsed star behind it,&mdash;in
that place it was rent asunder, and a star
passed across the opening in all its brightness,
and then vanished. Such stars exhibited themselves
only; surrounding objects did not partake
of their light. There were deep wells of knowledge,
but no fertilizing rills and rivulets. For
the drama, society was altogether a state of chaos,
out of which it was, for a while at least, to proceed
anew, as if there had been none before it. And
yet it is not undelightful to contemplate the
education of good from evil. The ignorance of
the great mass of our countrymen was the efficient
cause of the reproduction of the drama;
and the preceding darkness and the returning
light were alike necessary in order to the creation
of a Shakespeare.
</p>

<p>
The drama re-commenced in England, as it first
began in Greece, in religion. The people were not
able to read,&mdash;the priesthood were unwilling that
they should read; and yet their own interest
compelled them not to leave the people wholly
ignorant of the great events of sacred history.
They did that, therefore, by scenic representations,
which in after ages it has been attempted to do in
<pb n='020'/><anchor id='Pg020'/>
Roman Catholic countries by pictures. They presented
Mysteries, and often at great expense; and
reliques of this system still remain in the south of
Europe, and indeed throughout Italy, where at
Christmas the convents and the great nobles rival
each other in the scenic representation of the
birth of Christ and its circumstances. I heard
two instances mentioned to me at different times,
one in Sicily and the other in Rome, of noble
devotees, the ruin of whose fortunes was said to
have commenced in the extravagant expense
which had been incurred in presenting the
<hi rend='italic'>præsepe</hi> or manger. But these Mysteries, in
order to answer their design, must not only be
instructive, but entertaining; and as, when they
became so, the people began to take pleasure in
acting them themselves&mdash;in interloping&mdash;(against
which the priests seem to have fought hard and
yet in vain) the most ludicrous images were
mixed with the most awful personations; and
whatever the subject might be, however sublime,
however pathetic, yet the Vice and the Devil,
who are the genuine antecessors of Harlequin
and the Clown, were necessary component parts.
I have myself a piece of this kind, which I transcribed
a few years ago at Helmstadt, in Germany,
on the education of Eve's children, in
which after the fall and repentance of Adam, the
offended Maker, as in proof of his reconciliation,
condescends to visit them, and to catechise the
children,&mdash;who with a noble contempt of chronology
are all brought together from Abel to Noah.
The good children say the ten Commandments,
the Belief, and the Lord's Prayer; but Cain and
his rout, after he had received a box on the ear
<pb n='021'/><anchor id='Pg021'/>
for not taking off his hat, and afterwards offering
his left hand, is prompted by the devil so to
blunder in the Lord's Prayer as to reverse the
petitions and say it backward!
</p>

<p>
Unaffectedly I declare I feel pain at repetitions
like these, however innocent. As historical documents
they are valuable; but I am sensible that
what I can read with my eye with perfect innocence,
I cannot without inward fear and
misgivings pronounce with my tongue.
</p>

<p>
Let me, however, be acquitted of presumption
if I say that I cannot agree with Mr. Malone,
that our ancestors did not perceive the ludicrous
in these things, or that they paid no separate
attention to the serious and comic parts. Indeed
his own statement contradicts it. For what purpose
should the Vice leap upon the Devil's back
and belabour him, but to produce this separate
attention? The people laughed heartily, no
doubt. Nor can I conceive any meaning attached
to the words <q>separate attention,</q> that
is not fully answered by one part of an exhibition
exciting seriousness or pity, and the other
raising mirth and loud laughter. That they felt
no impiety in the affair is most true. For it is
the very essence of that system of Christian polytheism,
which in all its essentials is now fully as
gross in Spain, in Sicily, and the South of Italy, as
it ever was in England in the days of Henry VI.
(nay, more so, for a Wicliffe had not then appeared
only, but scattered the good seed widely),&mdash;it
is an essential part, I say, of that system to draw
the mind wholly from its own inward whispers and
quiet discriminations, and to habituate the conscience
to pronounce sentence in every case according
<pb n='022'/><anchor id='Pg022'/>
to the established verdicts of the church and
the casuists. I have looked through volume after
volume of the most approved casuists,&mdash;and still I
find disquisitions whether this or that act is right,
and under what circumstances, to a minuteness
that makes reasoning ridiculous, and of a callous
and unnatural immodesty, to which none but a
monk could harden himself, who has been stripped
of all the tender charities of life, yet is goaded on
to make war against them by the unsubdued
hauntings of our meaner nature, even as dogs are
said to get the <hi rend='italic'>hydrophobia</hi> from excessive thirst.
I fully believe that our ancestors laughed as
heartily, as their posterity do at Grimaldi;&mdash;and
not having been told that they would be punished
for laughing, they thought it very innocent;&mdash;and
if their priests had left out murder in the catalogue
of their prohibitions (as indeed they did under
certain circumstances of heresy), the greater part
of them,&mdash;the moral instincts common to all men
having been smothered and kept from development,&mdash;would
have thought as little of murder.
</p>

<p>
However this may be, the necessity of at once
instructing and gratifying the people produced the
great distinction between the Greek and the English
theatres;&mdash;for to this we must attribute the
origin of tragi-comedy, or a representation of
human events more lively, nearer the truth, and
permitting a larger field of moral instruction, a
more ample exhibition of the recesses of the human
heart, under all the trials and circumstances that
most concern us, than was known or guessed at by
Æschylus, Sophocles, or Euripides;&mdash;and at the
same time we learn to account for, and&mdash;relatively
to the author&mdash;perceive the necessity of, the Fool
<pb n='023'/><anchor id='Pg023'/>
or Clown or both, as the substitutes of the Vice
and the Devil, which our ancestors had been so
accustomed to see in every exhibition of the stage,
that they could not feel any performance perfect
without them. Even to this day in Italy, every
opera&mdash;(even Metastasio obeyed the claim throughout)&mdash;must
have six characters, generally two pairs
of cross lovers, a tyrant and a confidant, or a
father and two confidants, themselves lovers;&mdash;and
when a new opera appears, it is the universal
fashion to ask&mdash;which is the tyrant, which the
lover? &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
It is the especial honour of Christianity, that in
its worst and most corrupted form it cannot wholly
separate itself from morality;&mdash;whereas the other
religions in their best form (I do not include
Mohammedanism, which is only an anomalous corruption
of Christianity, like Swedenborgianism)
have no connection with it. The very impersonation
of moral evil under the name of Vice,
facilitated all other impersonations; and hence we
see that the Mysteries were succeeded by Moralities,
or dialogues and plots of allegorical personages.
Again, some character in real history had become
so famous, so proverbial, as Nero for instance, that
they were introduced instead of the moral quality,
for which they were so noted;&mdash;and in this manner
the stage was moving on to the absolute production
of heroic and comic real characters, when the restoration
of literature, followed by the ever-blessed
Reformation, let in upon the kingdom not only new
knowledge, but new motive. A useful rivalry commenced
between the metropolis on the one hand,&mdash;the
residence, independently of the court and
nobles, of the most active and stirring spirits who
<pb n='024'/><anchor id='Pg024'/>
had not been regularly educated, or who, from mischance
or otherwise, had forsaken the beaten track
of preferment,&mdash;and the universities on the other.
The latter prided themselves on their closer approximation
to the ancient rules and ancient regularity&mdash;taking
the theatre of Greece, or rather its
dim reflection, the rhetorical tragedies of the poet
Seneca, as a perfect ideal, without any critical
collation of the times, origin, or circumstances;&mdash;whilst,
in the mean time, the popular writers, who
could not and would not abandon what they had
found to delight their countrymen sincerely, and
not merely from inquiries first put to the recollection
of rules, and answered in the affirmative, as if
it had been an arithmetical sum, did yet borrow
from the scholars whatever they advantageously
could, consistently with their own peculiar means
of pleasing.
</p>

<p>
And here let me pause for a moment's contemplation
of this interesting subject.
</p>

<p>
We call, for we see and feel, the swan and the
dove both transcendantly beautiful. As absurd as
it would be to institute a comparison between their
separate claims to beauty from any abstract rule
common to both, without reference to the life and
being of the animals themselves,&mdash;or as if, having
first seen the dove, we abstracted its outlines, gave
them a false generalization, called them the principles
or ideal of bird-beauty, and then proceeded
to criticise the swan or the eagle;&mdash;not less absurd
is it to pass judgment on the works of a poet on
the mere ground that they have been called by the
same class-name with the works of other poets in
other times and circumstances, or on any ground,
indeed, save that of their inappropriateness to their
<pb n='025'/><anchor id='Pg025'/>
own end and being, their want of significance, as
symbols or physiognomy.
</p>

<p>
O! few have there been among critics, who have
followed with the eye of the imagination the imperishable
yet ever wandering spirit of poetry
through its various metempsychoses, and consequent
metamorphoses;&mdash;or who have rejoiced in
the light of clear perception at beholding with
each new birth, with each rare <hi rend='italic'>avatar</hi>, the human
race frame to itself a new body, by assimilating
materials of nourishment out of its new circumstances,
and work for itself new organs of power
appropriate to the new sphere of its motion and
activity!
</p>

<p>
I have before spoken of the Romance, or the
language formed out of the decayed Roman and
the Northern tongues; and comparing it with the
Latin, we find it less perfect in simplicity and relation&mdash;the
privileges of a language formed by the
mere attraction of homogeneous parts;&mdash;but yet
more rich, more expressive and various, as one
formed by more obscure affinities out of a chaos of
apparently heterogeneous atoms. As more than a
metaphor,&mdash;as an analogy of this, I have named
the true genuine modern poetry the romantic; and
the works of Shakespeare are romantic poetry, revealing
itself in the drama. If the tragedies of
Sophocles are in the strict sense of the word
tragedies, and the comedies of Aristophanes comedies,
we must emancipate ourselves from a false
association arising from misapplied names, and find
a new word for the plays of Shakespeare. For they
are, in the ancient sense, neither tragedies nor
comedies, nor both in one,&mdash;but a different <hi rend='italic'>genus</hi>,
diverse in kind, and not merely different in degree.
<pb n='026'/><anchor id='Pg026'/>
They may be called romantic dramas, or dramatic
romances.
</p>

<p>
A deviation from the simple forms and unities
of the ancient stage is an essential principle, and,
of course, an appropriate excellence, of the romantic
drama. For these unities were to a great
extent the natural form of that which in its
elements was homogeneous, and the representation
of which was addressed pre-eminently to the
outward senses;&mdash;and though the fable, the
language, and the characters appealed to the
reason rather than to the mere understanding,
inasmuch as they supposed an ideal state rather
than referred to an existing reality,&mdash;yet it was a
reason which was obliged to accommodate itself
to the senses, and so far became a sort of more
elevated understanding. On the other hand, the
romantic poetry&mdash;the Shakespearian drama&mdash;appealed
to the imagination rather than to the
senses, and to the reason as contemplating our
inward nature, and the workings of the passions
in their most retired recesses. But the reason,
as reason, is independent of time and space; it
has nothing to do with them: and hence the
certainties of reason have been called eternal
truths. As for example&mdash;the endless properties
of the circle:&mdash;what connection have they with
this or that age, with this or that country?&mdash;The
reason is aloof from time and space; the imagination
is an arbitrary controller over both;&mdash;and
if only the poet have such power of exciting our
internal emotions as to make us present to the
scene in imagination chiefly, he acquires the right
and privilege of using time and space as they
exist in imagination, and obedient only to the
<pb n='027'/><anchor id='Pg027'/>
laws by which the imagination itself acts. These
laws it will be my object and aim to point out as
the examples occur, which illustrate them. But
here let me remark what can never be too often
reflected on by all who would intelligently study
the works either of the Athenian dramatists, or of
Shakespeare, that the very essence of the former
consists in the sternest separation of the diverse in
kind and the disparate in the degree, whilst the
latter delights in interlacing, by a rainbow-like
transfusion of hues, the one with the other.
</p>

<p>
And here it will be necessary to say a few words
on the stage and on stage-illusion.
</p>

<p>
A theatre, in the widest sense of the word, is
the general term for all places of amusement
through the ear or eye, in which men assemble in
order to be amused by some entertainment presented
to all at the same time and in common.
Thus an old Puritan divine says:&mdash;<q>Those who
attend public worship and sermons only to amuse
themselves, make a theatre of the church, and turn
God's house into the devil's.
<foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">Theatra ædes diabololatricæ.</foreign></q>
The most important and dignified
species of this <hi rend='italic'>genus</hi> is, doubtless, the stage
(<foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">res
theatralis histrionica</foreign>), which, in addition to the generic
definition above given, may be characterized in
its idea, or according to what it does, or ought to,
aim at, as a combination of several or of all the
fine arts in an harmonious whole, having a distinct
end of its own, to which the peculiar end of each
of the component arts, taken separately, is made
subordinate and subservient,&mdash;that, namely, of
imitating reality&mdash;whether external things, actions,
or passions&mdash;-under a semblance of reality.
Thus, Claude imitates a landscape at sunset, but
<pb n='028'/><anchor id='Pg028'/>
only as a picture; while a forest-scene is not presented
to the spectators as a picture, but as a
forest; and though, in the full sense of the word,
we are no more deceived by the one than by the
other, yet are our feelings very differently affected;
and the pleasure derived from the one is not composed
of the same elements as that afforded by the
other, even on the supposition that the <hi rend='italic'>quantum</hi> of
both were equal. In the former, a picture, it is a
condition of all genuine delight that we should
not be deceived; in the latter, stage-scenery (inasmuch
as its principle end is not in or for itself, as
is the case in a picture, but to be an assistance and
means to an end out of itself), its very purpose is
to produce as much illusion as its nature permits.
These, and all other stage presentations, are to
produce a sort of temporary half-faith, which the
spectator encourages in himself and supports by a
voluntary contribution on his own part, because
he knows that it is at all times in his power to see
the thing as it really is. I have often observed
that little children are actually deceived by stage-scenery,
never by pictures; though even these
produce an effect on their impressible minds,
which they do not on the minds of adults. The
child, if strongly impressed, does not indeed positively
think the picture to be the reality; but yet
he does not think the contrary. As Sir George
Beaumont was shewing me a very fine engraving
from Rubens, representing a storm at sea without
any vessel or boat introduced, my little boy, then
about five years old, came dancing and singing
into the room, and all at once (if I may so say)
<emph>tumbled in</emph> upon the print. He instantly started,
stood silent and motionless, with the strongest expression,
<pb n='029'/><anchor id='Pg029'/>
first of wonder and then of grief in his
eyes and countenance, and at length said <q>And
where is the ship? But that is sunk, and the men
are all drowned!</q> still keeping his eyes fixed on
the print. Now what pictures are to little children,
stage illusion is to men, provided they retain
any part of the child's sensibility; except, that in
the latter instance, the suspension of the act of
comparison, which permits this sort of negative
belief, is somewhat more assisted by the will, than
in that of a child respecting a picture.
</p>

<p>
The true stage-illusion in this and in all other
things consists&mdash;not in the mind's judging it to be
a forest, but, in its remission of the judgment that
it is not a forest. And this subject of stage-illusion
is so important, and so many practical errors and
false criticisms may arise, and indeed have arisen,
either from reasoning on it as actual delusion (the
strange notion, on which the French critics built
up their theory, and on which the French poets
justify the construction of their tragedies), or
from denying it altogether (which seems the end
of Dr. Johnson's reasoning, and which, as extremes
meet, would lead to the very same consequences,
by excluding whatever would not be judged probable
by us in our coolest state of feeling, with all
our faculties in even balance), that these few remarks
will, I hope, be pardoned, if they should
serve either to explain or to illustrate the point.
For not only are we never absolutely deluded&mdash;or
any thing like it, but the attempt to cause the
highest delusion possible to beings in their senses
sitting in a theatre, is a gross fault, incident only
to low minds, which, feeling that they cannot
affect the heart or head permanently, endeavour to
<pb n='030'/><anchor id='Pg030'/>
call forth the momentary affections. There ought
never to be more pain than is compatible with coexisting
pleasure, and to be amply repaid by
thought.
</p>

<p>
Shakespeare found the infant stage demanding
an intermixture of ludicrous character as imperiously
as that of Greece did the chorus, and high
language accordant. And there are many advantages
in this;&mdash;a greater assimilation to nature, a
greater scope of power, more truths, and more
feelings;&mdash;the effects of contrast, as in Lear and
the Fool; and especially this, that the true
language of passion becomes sufficiently elevated
by your having previously heard, in the same
piece, the lighter conversation of men under no
strong emotion. The very nakedness of the stage,
too, was advantageous,&mdash;for the drama thence
became something between recitation and a representation;
and the absence or paucity of scenes
allowed a freedom from the laws of unity of place
and unity of time, the observance of which must
either confine the drama to as few subjects as may
be counted on the fingers, or involve gross improbabilities,
far more striking than the violation
would have caused. Thence, also, was precluded
the danger of a false ideal,&mdash;of aiming at more
than what is possible on the whole. What play
of the ancients, with reference to their ideal, does
not hold out more glaring absurdities than any in
Shakespeare? On the Greek plan a man could
more easily be a poet than a dramatist; upon our
plan more easily a dramatist than a poet.

Unaccustomed to address such an audience,
and having lost by a long interval of confinement
the advantages of my former short schooling,
I had miscalculated in my last Lecture the proportion
of my matter to my time, and by bad
economy and unskilful management, the several
heads of my discourse failed in making the entire
performance correspond with the promise publicly
circulated in the weekly annunciation of the subjects
to be treated. It would indeed have been
wiser in me, and perhaps better on the whole, if I
had caused my Lectures to be announced only as
continuations of the main subject. But if I be,
as perforce I must be, gratified by the recollection
of whatever has appeared to give you pleasure, I
am conscious of something better, though less
flattering, a sense of unfeigned gratitude for your
forbearance with my defects. Like affectionate
guardians, you see without disgust the awkwardness,
and witness with sympathy the growing
pains, of a youthful endeavour, and look forward
with a hope, which is its own reward, to the
contingent results of practice&mdash;to its intellectual
maturity.
</p>

<p>
In my last address I defined poetry to be the
art, or whatever better term our language may
afford, of representing external nature and human
thoughts, both relatively to human affections, so as
<pb n='032'/><anchor id='Pg032'/>
to cause the production of as great immediate
pleasure in each part, as is compatible with the
largest possible sum of pleasure on the whole.
Now this definition applies equally to painting
and music as to poetry; and in truth the term
poetry is alike applicable to all three. The vehicle
alone constitutes the difference; and the term
<q>poetry</q> is rightly applied by eminence to
measured words, only because the sphere of their
action is far wider, the power of giving permanence
to them much more certain, and incomparably
greater the facility, by which men, not
defective by nature or disease, may be enabled to
derive habitual pleasure and instruction from
them. On my mentioning these considerations
to a painter of great genius, who had been, from
a most honourable enthusiasm, extolling his own
art, he was so struck with their truth, that he
exclaimed, <q>I want no other arguments;&mdash;poetry,
that is, verbal poetry, must be the greatest; all
that proves final causes in the world, proves this;
it would be shocking to think otherwise!</q>&mdash;And
in truth, deeply, O! far more than words can
express, as I venerate the Last Judgment and the
Prophets of Michel Angelo Buonarotti,&mdash;yet the
very pain which I repeatedly felt as I lost myself
in gazing upon them, the painful consideration
that their having been painted in
<foreign lang="it" rend="font-style: italic">fresco</foreign> was the
sole cause that they had not been abandoned to all
the accidents of a dangerous transportation to a
distant capital, and that the same caprice, which
made the Neapolitan soldiery destroy all the exquisite
masterpieces on the walls of the church of
<hi rend='italic'>Trinitado Monte</hi>, after the retreat of their antagonist
barbarians, might as easily have made vanish
<pb n='033'/><anchor id='Pg033'/>
the rooms and open gallery of Raffael, and the yet
more unapproachable wonders of the sublime
Florentine in the Sixtine Chapel, forced upon my
mind the reflection: How grateful the human
race ought to be that the works of Euclid, Newton,
Plato, Milton, Shakespeare, are not subjected
to similar contingencies,&mdash;that they and their
fellows, and the great, though inferior, peerage of
undying intellect, are secured;&mdash;secured even
from a second irruption of Goths and Vandals, in
addition to many other safeguards, by the vast
empire of English language, laws, and religion
founded in America, through the overflow of the
power and the virtue of my country;&mdash;and that
now the great and certain works of genuine fame
can only cease to act for mankind, when men
themselves cease to be men, or when the planet on
which they exist, shall have altered its relations,
or have ceased to be. Lord Bacon, in the language
of the gods, if I may use an Homeric phrase, has
expressed a similar thought:&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend="display">
<q>Lastly, leaving the vulgar arguments, that by learning man excelleth
man in that wherein man excelleth beasts; that by learning
man ascendeth to the heavens and their motions, where in body he
cannot come, and the like; let us conclude with the dignity and
excellency of knowledge and learning in that whereunto man's
nature doth most aspire, which is immortality or continuance: for
to this tendeth generation, and raising of houses and families; to
this tend buildings, foundations, and monuments; to this tendeth
the desire of memory, fame, and celebration, and in effect the
strength of all other human desires. We see then how far the
monuments of wit and learning are more durable than the monuments
of power, or of the hands. For have not the verses of Homer
continued twenty-five hundred years, or more, without the loss of a
syllable or letter; during which time, infinite palaces, temples,
castles, cities, have been decayed and demolished? It is not possible
to have the true pictures or statues of Cyrus, Alexander,
Cæsar; no, nor of the kings or great personages of much later
years; for the originals cannot last, and the copies cannot but lose
of the life and truth. But the images of men's wits and knowledges
<pb n='034'/><anchor id='Pg034'/>
remain in books, exempted from the wrong of time, and capable of
perpetual renovation. Neither are they fitly to be called images,
because they generate still, and cast their seeds in the minds of
others, provoking and causing infinite actions and opinions in succeeding
ages: so that, if the invention of the ship was thought so
noble, which carrieth riches and commodities from place to place,
and consociateth the most remote regions in participation of their
fruits; how much more are letters to be magnified, which, as ships,
pass through the vast seas of time, and make ages so distant to participate
of the wisdom, illuminations, and inventions, the one of the
other?</q>

<p>
But let us now consider what the drama should
be. And first, it is not a copy, but an imitation, of
nature. This is the universal principle of the fine
arts. In all well laid out grounds what delight do
we feel from that balance and antithesis of feelings
and thoughts! How natural! we say;&mdash;but the
very wonder that caused the exclamation, implies
that we perceived art at the same moment. We
catch the hint from nature itself. Whenever in
mountains or cataracts we discover a likeness to
any thing artificial which yet we know is not artificial&mdash;what
pleasure! And so it is in appearances
known to be artificial, which appear to be natural.
This applies in due degrees, regulated by steady
good sense, from a clump of trees to the <hi rend='italic'>Paradise
Lost</hi> or <hi rend='italic'>Othello</hi>. It would be easy to apply it to
painting and even, though with greater abstraction
of thought, and by more subtle yet equally just
analogies&mdash;to music. But this belongs to others;
suffice it that one great principle is common to all
the fine arts, a principle which probably is the
condition of all consciousness, without which we
should feel and imagine only by discontinuous
moments, and be plants or brute animals instead
of men;&mdash;I mean that ever-varying balance, or
balancing, of images, notions, or feelings, conceived
as in opposition to each other;&mdash;in short, the
<pb n='035'/><anchor id='Pg035'/>
perception of identity and contrariety; the least
degree of which constitutes likeness, the greatest
absolute difference; but the infinite gradations between
these two form all the play and all the
interest of our intellectual and moral being, till it
leads us to a feeling and an object more awful than
it seems to me compatible with even the present subject
to utter aloud, though I am most desirous to
suggest it. For there alone are all things at once
different and the same; there alone, as the principle
of all things, does distinction exist unaided
by division; there are will and reason, succession
of time and unmoving eternity, infinite change and
ineffable rest!&mdash;

We may divide a dramatic poet's characteristics
before we enter into the component merits of any
one work, and with reference only to those things
which are to be the materials of all, into language,
passion, and character; always bearing in mind
that these must act and react on each other,&mdash;the
language inspired by the passion, and the language
and the passion modified and differenced by the
character. To the production of the highest excellencies
in these three, there are requisite in the
mind of the author;&mdash;good sense, talent, sensibility,
imagination;&mdash;and to the perfection of a
work we should add two faculties of lesser importance,
yet necessary for the ornaments and foliage
of the column and the roof&mdash;fancy and a quick
sense of beauty.
</p>

<pb n='036'/><anchor id='Pg036'/>

<p>
As to language;&mdash;it cannot be supposed that
the poet should make his characters say all that
they would, or that, his whole drama considered,
each scene, or paragraph should be such as, on cool
examination, we can conceive it likely that men in
such situations would say, in that order, or with
that perfection. And yet, according to my feelings,
it is a very inferior kind of poetry, in which,
as in the French tragedies, men are made to talk
in a style which few indeed even of the wittiest
can be supposed to converse in, and which both is,
and on a moment's reflection appears to be, the
natural produce of the hot-bed of vanity, namely,
the closet of an author, who is actuated originally
by a desire to excite surprise and wonderment at
his own superiority to other men,&mdash;instead of
having felt so deeply on certain subjects, or in
consequence of certain imaginations, as to make it
almost a necessity of his nature to seek for sympathy,&mdash;no
doubt, with that honourable desire of
permanent action, which distinguishes genius.&mdash;Where
then is the difference?&mdash;In this that each
part should be proportionate, though the whole
may be perhaps, impossible. At all events, it
should be compatible with sound sense and logic in
the mind of the poet himself.
</p>

<p>
It is to be lamented that we judge of books by
books, instead of referring what we read to our
own experience. One great use of books is to
make their contents a motive for observation. The
German tragedies have in some respects been justly
ridiculed. In them the dramatist often becomes a
novelist in his directions to the actors, and thus
degrades tragedy into pantomime. Yet still the
consciousness of the poet's mind must be diffused
<pb n='037'/><anchor id='Pg037'/>
over that of the reader or spectator; but he himself,
according to his genius, elevates us, and by
being always in keeping, prevents us from perceiving
any strangeness, though we feel great
exultation. Many different kinds of style may be
admirable, both in different men, and in different
parts of the same poem.
</p>

<p>
See the different language which strong feelings
may justify in Shylock, and learn from Shakespeare's
conduct of that character the terrible force
of every plain and calm diction, when known to
proceed from a resolved and impassioned man.
</p>

<p>
It is especially with reference to the drama, and
its characteristics in any given nation, or at any
particular period, that the dependence of genius on
the public taste becomes a matter of the deepest
importance. I do not mean that taste which
springs merely from caprice or fashionable imitation,
and which, in fact, genius can, and by degrees
will, create for itself; but that which arises out of
wide-grasping and heart-enrooted causes, which
is epidemic, and in the very air that all breathe.
This it is which kills, or withers, or corrupts.
Socrates, indeed, might walk arm in arm with
Hygeia, whilst pestilence, with a thousand furies
running to and fro, and clashing against each
other in a complexity and agglomeration of horrors,
was shooting her darts of fire and venom all around
him. Even such was Milton; yea, and such, in
spite of all that has been babbled by his critics in
pretended excuse for his damning, because for them
too profound excellencies,&mdash;such was Shakespeare.
But alas! the exceptions prove the rule. For who
will dare to force his way out of the crowd,&mdash;not
of the mere vulgar,&mdash;but of the vain and banded
<pb n='038'/><anchor id='Pg038'/>
aristocracy of intellect, and presume to join the
almost supernatural beings that stand by themselves
aloof?
</p>

<p>
Of this diseased epidemic influence there are two
forms especially preclusive of tragic worth. The
first is the necessary growth of a sense and love of
the ludicrous, and a morbid sensibility of the assimilative
power,&mdash;an inflammation produced by
cold and weakness,&mdash;which in the boldest bursts of
passion will lie in wait for a jeer at any phrase,
that may have an accidental coincidence in the
mere words with something base or trivial. For
instance,&mdash;to express woods, not on a plain, but
clothing a hill, which overlooks a valley, or dell,
or river, or the sea,&mdash;the trees rising one above
another, as the spectators in an ancient theatre,&mdash;I
know no other word in our language (bookish
and pedantic terms out of the question), but <emph>hanging</emph>
woods, the
<foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">sylvæ superimpendentes</foreign>
of Catullus;
yet let some wit call out in a slang tone,&mdash;<q>the
gallows!</q> and a peal of laughter would damn the
play. Hence it is that so many dull pieces have
had a decent run, only because nothing unusual
above, or absurd below, mediocrity furnished an
occasion,&mdash;a spark for the explosive materials collected
behind the orchestra. But it would take a
volume of no ordinary size, however laconically the
sense were expressed, if it were meant to instance
the effects, and unfold all the causes, of this disposition
upon the moral, intellectual, and even
physical character of a people, with its influences
on domestic life and individual deportment. A
good document upon this subject would be the
history of Paris society and of French, that is,
Parisian, literature from the commencement of the
<pb n='039'/><anchor id='Pg039'/>
latter half of the reign of Louis XIV. to that of
Buonaparte, compared with the preceding philosophy
and poetry even of Frenchmen themselves.
</p>

<p>
The second form, or more properly, perhaps,
another distinct cause, of this diseased disposition
is matter of exultation to the philanthropist and
philosopher, and of regret to the poet, the painter,
and the statuary alone, and to them only as poets,
painters, and statuaries;&mdash;namely, the security, the
comparative equability, and ever increasing sameness
of human life. Men are now so seldom thrown
into wild circumstances, and violences of excitement,
that the language of such states, the laws of
association of feeling with thought, the starts and
strange far-flights of the assimilative power on the
slightest and least obvious likeness presented by
thoughts, words, or objects,&mdash;these are all judged
of by authority, not by actual experience,&mdash;by what
men have been accustomed to regard as symbols of
these states, and not the natural symbols, or self-manifestations
of them.
</p>

<p>
Even so it is in the language of man, and in
that of nature. The sound <hi rend='italic'>sun</hi>, or the figures
<hi rend='italic'>s</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>u</hi>,
<hi rend='italic'>n</hi>, are purely arbitrary modes of recalling the
object, and for visual mere objects they are not
only sufficient, but have infinite advantages from
their very nothingness <hi rend='italic'>per se</hi>. But the language
of nature is a subordinate <hi rend='italic'>Logos</hi>, that was in the
beginning, and was with the thing it represented,
and was the thing it represented.
</p>

<p>
Now the language of Shakespeare, in his <hi rend='italic'>Lear</hi>
for instance, is a something intermediate between
these two; or rather it is the former blended with
the latter,&mdash;the arbitrary, not merely recalling the
cold notion of the thing, but expressing the reality
<pb n='040'/><anchor id='Pg040'/>
of it, and, as arbitrary language is an heir-loom of
the human race, being itself a part of that which
it manifests. What shall I deduce from the preceding
positions? Even this,&mdash;the appropriate,
the never to be too much valued advantage of the
theatre, if only the actors were what we know they
have been,&mdash;a delightful, yet most effectual remedy
for this dead palsy of the public mind. What
would appear mad or ludicrous in a book, when presented
to the senses under the form of reality, and
with the truth of nature, supplies a species of actual
experience. This is indeed the special privilege of
a great actor over a great poet. No part was ever
played in perfection, but nature justified herself in
the hearts of all her children, in what state soever
they were, short of absolute moral exhaustion, or
downright stupidity. There is no time given to
ask questions, or to pass judgments; we are taken
by storm, and, though in the histrionic art many a
clumsy counterfeit, by caricature of one or two
features, may gain applause as a fine likeness, yet
never was the very thing rejected as a counterfeit.
O! when I think of the inexhaustible mine of virgin
treasure in our Shakespeare, that I have been
almost daily reading him since I was ten years old,&mdash;that
the thirty intervening years have been unintermittingly
and not fruitlessly employed in
the study of the Greek, Latin, English, Italian,
Spanish, and German <hi rend='italic'>belle lettrists</hi>, and the last
fifteen years in addition, far more intensely in the
analysis of the laws of life and reason as they exist
in man,&mdash;and that upon every step I have made
forward in taste, in acquisition of facts from history
or my own observation, and in knowledge of the
different laws of being and their apparent exceptions,
<pb n='041'/><anchor id='Pg041'/>
from accidental collision of disturbing forces,&mdash;that
at every new accession of information, after
every successful exercise of meditation, and every
fresh presentation of experience, I have unfailingly
discovered a proportionate increase of wisdom and
intuition in Shakespeare;&mdash;when I know this, and
know too, that by a conceivable and possible, though
hardly to be expected, arrangement of the British
theatres, not all, indeed, but a large, a very large,
proportion of this indefinite all&mdash;(round which no
comprehension has yet drawn the line of circumscription,
so as to say to itself, <q>I have seen the
whole</q>)&mdash;might be sent into the heads and hearts&mdash;into
the very souls of the mass of mankind, to
whom, except by this living comment and interpretation,
it must remain for ever a sealed volume,
a deep well without a wheel or a windlass;&mdash;it
seems to me a pardonable enthusiasm to steal away
from sober likelihood, and share in so rich a feast
in the faery world of possibility! Yet even in the
grave cheerfulness of a circumspect hope, much,
very much, might be done; enough, assuredly,
to furnish a kind and strenuous nature with ample
motives for the attempt to effect what may be
effected.

<head>Shakespeare, A Poet Generally.</head>

<p>
Clothed in radiant armour, and authorized by
titles sure and manifold, as a poet, Shakespeare
came forward to demand the throne of fame, as the
dramatic poet of England. His excellences compelled
even his contemporaries to seat him on that
throne, although there were giants in those days
contending for the same honour. Hereafter I
would fain endeavour to make out the title of the
English drama as created by, and existing in,
Shakespeare, and its right to the supremacy of
dramatic excellence in general. But he had shown
himself a poet, previously to his appearance as a
dramatic poet; and had no <hi rend='italic'>Lear</hi>,
no <hi rend='italic'>Othello</hi>, no <hi rend='italic'>Henry IV.</hi>,
no <hi rend='italic'>Twelfth Night</hi> ever appeared, we
must have admitted that Shakespeare possessed the
chief, if not every, requisite of a poet,&mdash;deep feeling
and exquisite sense of beauty, both as exhibited
to the eye in the combinations of form, and to the
ear in sweet and appropriate melody; that these
feelings were under the command of his own will;
that in his very first productions he projected his
mind out of his own particular being, and felt, and
made others feel, on subjects no way connected
with himself, except by force of contemplation and
that sublime faculty by which a great mind becomes
that on which it meditates. To this must be
added that affectionate love of nature and natural
<pb n='044'/><anchor id='Pg044'/>
objects, without which no man could have observed
so steadily, or painted so truly and passionately,
the very minutest beauties of the external world:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">And when thou hast on foot the purblind hare,</q></l>
<l>Mark the poor wretch; to overshoot his troubles,</l>
<l>How he outruns the wind, and with what care,</l>
<l>He cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles;</l>
<l>The many musits through the which he goes</l>
<l>Are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">Sometimes he runs among the flock of sheep,</q></l>
<l>To make the cunning hounds mistake their smell;</l>
<l>And sometime where earth-delving conies keep,</l>
<l>To stop the loud pursuers in their yell;</l>
<l>And sometime sorteth with the herd of deer:</l>
<l>Danger deviseth shifts, wit waits on fear.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">For there his smell with others' being mingled,</q></l>
<l>The hot scent-snuffing hounds are driven to doubt,</l>
<l>Ceasing their clamorous cry, till they have singled</l>
<l>With much ado, the cold fault cleanly out,</l>
<l>Then do they spend their mouths; echo replies,</l>
<l>As if another chase were in the skies.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">By this poor Wat far off, upon a hill,</q></l>
<l>Stands on his hinder legs with listening ear,</l>
<l>To harken if his foes pursue him still:</l>
<l>Anon their loud alarums he doth hear,</l>
<l>And now his grief may be compared well</l>
<l>To one sore-sick, that hears the passing bell.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">Then shalt thou see the dew-bedabbled wretch</q></l>
<l>Turn, and return, indenting with the way:</l>
<l>Each envious briar his weary legs doth scratch,</l>
<l>Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay.</l>
<l>For misery is trodden on by many,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And being low, never relieved by any.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l><hi rend='italic'>Venus and Adonis.</hi></l>
</lg>

<p>
And the preceding description:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">But lo! from forth a copse that neighbours by,</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">A breeding jennet, lusty, young and proud,</q> &amp;c.</l>
</lg>

<p>
is much more admirable, but in parts less fitted for
quotation.
</p>

<pb n='045'/><anchor id='Pg045'/>

<p>
Moreover Shakespeare had shown that he possessed
fancy, considered as the faculty of bringing
together images dissimilar in the main by some one
point or more of likeness, as in such a passage as
this:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">Full gently now she takes him by the hand,</q></l>
<l>A lily prisoned in a jail of snow,</l>
<l>Or ivory in an alabaster band:</l>
<l><q rend="post">So white a friend ingirts so white a foe!</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Ib.</hi></l>
</lg>

<p>
And still mounting the intellectual ladder, he
had as unequivocally proved the indwelling in his
mind of imagination, or the power by which one
image or feeling is made to modify many others,
and by a sort of fusion to force many into one;&mdash;that
which afterwards showed itself in such might
and energy in Lear, where the deep anguish of a
father spreads the feeling of ingratitude and cruelty
over the very elements of heaven;&mdash;and which,
combining many circumstances into one moment of
consciousness, tends to produce that ultimate end
of all human thought and human feeling, unity,
and thereby the reduction of the spirit to its principle
and fountain, who is alone truly one. Various
are the workings of this the greatest faculty of the
human mind, both passionate and tranquil. In
its tranquil and purely pleasurable operation, it
acts chiefly by creating out of many things, as they
would have appeared in the description of an ordinary
mind, detailed in unimpassioned succession, a
oneness, even as nature, the greatest of poets, acts
upon us, when we open our eyes upon an extended
prospect. Thus the flight of Adonis in the dusk of
the evening:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">Look! how a bright star shooteth from the sky;</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">So glides he in the night from Venus' eye!</q></l>
</lg>

<pb n='046'/><anchor id='Pg046'/>

<p>
How many images and feelings are here brought
together without effort and without discord, in the
beauty of Adonis, the rapidity of his flight, the
yearning, yet hopelessness, of the enamoured gazer,
while a shadowy ideal character is thrown over the
whole! Or this power acts by impressing the stamp
of humanity, and of human feelings, on inanimate
or mere natural objects:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">Lo! here the gentle lark, weary of rest,</q></l>
<l>From his moist cabinet mounts up on high,</l>
<l>And wakes the morning, from whose silver breast</l>
<l>The sun ariseth in his majesty,</l>
<l>Who doth the world so gloriously behold,</l>
<l><q rend="post">The cedar-tops and hills seem burnish'd gold.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
Or again, it acts by so carrying on the eye of
the reader as to make him almost lose the consciousness
of words,&mdash;to make him see every thing
flashed, as Wordsworth has grandly and appropriately
said:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre"><hi rend='italic'>Flashed</hi> upon the inward eye</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">Which is the bliss of solitude;</q>&mdash;</l>
</lg>

<p>
and this without exciting any painful or laborious
attention, without any anatomy of description (a
fault not uncommon in descriptive poetry),&mdash;but
with the sweetness and easy movement of nature.
This energy is an absolute essential of poetry, and
of itself would constitute a poet, though not one of
the highest class;&mdash;it is, however, a most hopeful
symptom, and the <hi rend='italic'>Venus and Adonis</hi> is one continued
specimen of it.
</p>

<p>
In this beautiful poem there is an endless activity
of thought in all the possible associations of thought
with thought, thought with feeling, or with words,
of feelings with feelings, and of words with words.
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">Even as the sun, with purple-colour'd face,</q></l>
<l>Had ta'en his last leave of the weeping morn,</l>
<pb n='047'/><anchor id='Pg047'/>
<l>Rose-cheek'd Adonis hied him to the chase:</l>
<l>Hunting he loved, but love he laughed to scorn.</l>
<l>Sick-thoughted Venus makes amain unto him,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And like a bold-faced suitor 'gins to woo him.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
Remark the humanizing imagery and circumstances
of the first two lines, and the activity of
thought in the play of words in the fourth line.
The whole stanza presents at once the time, the
appearance of the morning, and the two persons
distinctly characterised, and in six simple lines
puts the reader in possession of the whole argument
of the poem.
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">Over one arm the lusty courser's rein,</q></l>
<l>Under the other was the tender boy,</l>
<l>Who blush'd and pouted in a dull disdain,</l>
<l>With leaden appetite, unapt to toy,</l>
<l>She red and hot, as coals of glowing fire,</l>
<l><q rend="post">He red for shame, but frosty to desire:</q>&mdash;</l>
</lg>

<p>
This stanza and the two following afford good instances
of that poetic power, which I mentioned
above, of making every thing present to the imagination&mdash;both
the forms, and the passions which
modify those forms, either actually, as in the representations
of love or anger, or other human affections;
or imaginatively, by the different manner in
which inanimate objects, or objects unimpassioned
themselves, are caused to be seen by the mind in
moments of strong excitement, and according to
the kind of the excitement,&mdash;whether of jealousy,
or rage, or love, in the only appropriate sense of
the word, or of the lower impulses of our nature, or
finally of the poetic feeling itself. It is, perhaps,
chiefly in the power of producing and reproducing
the latter that the poet stands distinct.
</p>

<p>
The subject of the <hi rend='italic'>Venus and Adonis</hi> is unpleasing;
but the poem itself is for that very reason
<pb n='048'/><anchor id='Pg048'/>
the more illustrative of Shakespeare. There are
men who can write passages of deepest pathos and
even sublimity on circumstances personal to themselves
and stimulative of their own passions; but
they are not, therefore, on this account poets.
Read that magnificent burst of woman's patriotism
and exultation, <hi rend='italic'>Deborah's Song of Victory</hi>; it is
glorious, but nature is the poet there. It is quite
another matter to become all things and yet remain
the same,&mdash;to make the changeful god be felt in the
river, the lion, and the flame;&mdash;this it is, that is
the true imagination. Shakespeare writes in this
poem, as if he were of another planet, charming
you to gaze on the movements of Venus and Adonis,
as you would on the twinkling dances of two vernal
butterflies.
</p>

<p>
Finally, in this poem and the <hi rend='italic'>Rape of Lucrece</hi>,
Shakespeare gave ample proof of his possession of
a most profound, energetic, and philosophical mind,
without which he might have pleased, but could
not have been a great dramatic poet. Chance and
the necessity of his genius combined to lead him to
the drama his proper province: in his conquest of
which we should consider both the difficulties which
opposed him, and the advantages by which he was
assisted.

<head>Shakespeare's Judgment equal to his Genius.</head>

<p>
Thus then Shakespeare appears, from his <hi rend='italic'>Venus
and Adonis</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>Rape of Lucrece</hi> alone, apart from
all his great works, to have possessed all the conditions
of the true poet. Let me now proceed to
destroy, as far as may be in my power, the popular
notion that he was a great dramatist by mere instinct,
<pb n='049'/><anchor id='Pg049'/>
that he grew immortal in his own despite,
and sank below men of second or third rate power,
when he attempted aught beside the drama&mdash;even
as bees construct their cells and manufacture their
honey to admirable perfection; but would in vain
attempt to build a nest. Now this mode of reconciling
a compelled sense of inferiority with a feeling
of pride, began in a few pedants, who having read
that Sophocles was the great model of tragedy, and
Aristotle the infallible dictator of its rules, and
finding that the <hi rend='italic'>Lear</hi>,
<hi rend='italic'>Hamlet</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>Othello</hi> and other
master-pieces were neither in imitation of Sophocles,
nor in obedience to Aristotle,&mdash;and not having
(with one or two exceptions) the courage to affirm,
that the delight which their country received from
generation to generation, in defiance of the alterations
of circumstances and habits, was wholly
groundless,&mdash;took upon them, as a happy medium
and refuge, to talk of Shakespeare as a sort of
beautiful <hi rend='italic'>lusus naturæ</hi>, a delightful monster,&mdash;wild,
indeed, and without taste or judgment, but like the
inspired idiots so much venerated in the East,
uttering, amid the strangest follies, the sublimest
truths. In nine places out of ten in which I find
his awful name mentioned, it is with some epithet
of <q>wild,</q> <q>irregular,</q> <q>pure child of nature,</q>
&amp;c. If all this be true, we must submit to it;
though to a thinking mind it cannot but be painful
to find any excellence, merely human, thrown
out of all human analogy, and thereby leaving us
neither rules for imitation, nor motives to imitate;&mdash;but
if false, it is a dangerous falsehood;&mdash;for it
affords a refuge to secret self-conceit,&mdash;enables a
vain man at once to escape his reader's indignation
by general swoln panegyrics, and merely by his
<pb n='050'/><anchor id='Pg050'/>
<hi rend='italic'>ipse dixit</hi> to treat, as contemptible, what he has not
intellect enough to comprehend, or soul to feel,
without assigning any reason, or referring his
opinion to any demonstrative principle;&mdash;thus leaving
Shakespeare as a sort of grand Lama, adored
indeed, and his very excrements prized as relics,
but with no authority or real influence. I grieve
that every late voluminous edition of his works
would enable me to substantiate the present charge
with a variety of facts, one-tenth of which would
of themselves exhaust the time allotted to me.
Every critic, who has or has not made a collection
of black letter books&mdash;in itself a useful
and respectable amusement,&mdash;puts on the seven-league
boots of self-opinion, and strides at once
from an illustrator into a supreme judge, and
blind and deaf, fills his three-ounce phial at the
waters of Niagara; and determines positively the
greatness of the cataract to be neither more nor
less than his three-ounce phial has been able to
receive.
</p>

<p>
I think this a very serious subject. It is my
earnest desire&mdash;my passionate endeavour&mdash;to enforce
at various times and by various arguments
and instances the close and reciprocal connection
of just taste with pure morality. Without that
acquaintance with the heart of man, or that docility
and childlike gladness to be made acquainted
with it, which those only can have, who dare look
at their own hearts&mdash;and that with a steadiness
which religion only has the power of reconciling
with sincere humility;&mdash;without this, and the
modesty produced by it, I am deeply convinced
that no man, however wide his erudition, however
patient his antiquarian researches, can possibly
<pb n='051'/><anchor id='Pg051'/>
understand, or be worthy of understanding, the
writings of Shakespeare.
</p>

<p>
Assuredly that criticism of Shakespeare will alone
be genial which is reverential. The Englishman
who, without reverence&mdash;a proud and affectionate
reverence&mdash;can utter the name of William Shakespeare,
stands disqualified for the office of critic.
He wants one at least of the very senses, the
language of which he is to employ, and will discourse
at best but as a blind man, while the whole
harmonious creation of light and shade with all
its subtle interchange of deepening and dissolving
colours rises in silence to the silent <hi rend='italic'>fiat</hi> of the uprising
Apollo. However inferior in ability I may
be to some who have followed me, I own I am
proud that I was the first in time who publicly
demonstrated to the full extent of the position,
that the supposed irregularity and extravagances
of Shakespeare were the mere dreams of a pedantry
that arraigned the eagle because it had not the
dimensions of the swan. In all the successive
courses of lectures delivered by me, since my first
attempt at the Royal Institution, it has been, and
it still remains, my object, to prove that in all
points from the most important to the most
minute, the judgment of Shakespeare is commensurate
with his genius,&mdash;nay, that his genius
reveals itself in his judgment, as in its most
exalted form. And the more gladly do I recur
to this subject from the clear conviction, that to
judge aright, and with distinct consciousness of
the grounds of our judgment, concerning the
works of Shakespeare, implies the power and the
means of judging rightly of all other works of
intellect, those of abstract science alone excepted.
</p>

<pb n='052'/><anchor id='Pg052'/>

<p>
It is a painful truth, that not only individuals,
but even whole nations, are ofttimes so enslaved
to the habits of their education and immediate
circumstances, as not to judge disinterestedly even
on those subjects, the very pleasure arising from
which consists in its disinterestedness, namely, on
subjects of taste and polite literature. Instead of
deciding concerning their own modes and customs
by any rule of reason, nothing appears rational,
becoming, or beautiful to them, but what coincides
with the peculiarities of their education. In this
narrow circle, individuals may attain to exquisite
discrimination, as the French critics have done in
their own literature; but a true critic can no more
be such without placing himself on some central
point, from which he may command the whole,&mdash;that
is, some general rule, which, founded in
reason, or the faculties common to all men, must
therefore apply to each,&mdash;than an astronomer can
explain the movements of the solar system without
taking his stand in the sun. And let me remark,
that this will not tend to produce despotism, but,
on the contrary, true tolerance, in the critic. He
will, indeed, require, as the spirit and substance of
a work, something true in human nature itself,
and independent of all circumstances; but in the
mode of applying it, he will estimate genius and
judgment according to the felicity with which the
imperishable soul of intellect shall have adapted
itself to the age, the place, and the existing manners.
The error he will expose, lies in reversing
this, and holding up the mere circumstances as
perpetual to the utter neglect of the power which
can alone animate them. For art cannot exist
without, or apart from nature; and what has man
<pb n='053'/><anchor id='Pg053'/>
of his own to give to his fellow man, but his own
thoughts and feelings, and his observations, so far
as they are modified by his own thoughts or
feelings?
</p>

<p>
Let me, then, once more submit this question to
minds emancipated alike from national, or party,
or sectarian prejudice:&mdash;Are the plays of Shakespeare
works of rude uncultivated genius, in
which the splendour of the parts compensates, if
aught can compensate, for the barbarous shapelessness
and irregularity of the whole?&mdash;Or is the
form equally admirable with the matter, and the
judgment of the great poet not less deserving our
wonder than his genius?&mdash;Or, again, to repeat the
question in other words:&mdash;is Shakespeare a great
dramatic poet on account only of those beauties
and excellences which he possesses in common
with the ancients, but with diminished claims to
our love and honour to the full extent of his differences
from them?&mdash;Or are these very differences
additional proofs of poetic wisdom, at once results
and symbols of living power as contrasted with
lifeless mechanism&mdash;of free and rival originality
as contradistinguished from servile imitation, or,
more accurately, a blind copying of effects, instead
of a true imitation of the essential principles?&mdash;Imagine
not that I am about to oppose genius to
rules. No! the comparative value of these rules
is the very cause to be tried. The spirit of poetry,
like all other living powers, must of necessity
circumscribe itself by rules, were it only to unite
power with beauty. It must embody in order to
reveal itself; but a living body is of necessity an
organized one; and what is organization but the
connection of parts in and for a whole, so that
<pb n='054'/><anchor id='Pg054'/>
each part is at once end and means?&mdash;This is no
discovery of criticism;&mdash;it is a necessity of the
human mind; and all nations have felt and obeyed
it, in the invention of metre, and measured
sounds, as the vehicle and <hi rend='italic'>involucrum</hi> of poetry&mdash;itself
a fellow-growth from the same life,&mdash;even
as the bark is to the tree!
</p>

<p>
No work of true genius dares want its appropriate
form, neither indeed is there any danger of
this. As it must not, so genius cannot, be lawless;
for it is even this that constitutes it genius&mdash;the
power of acting creatively under laws of its own
origination. How then comes it that not only
single <hi rend='italic'>Zoili</hi>, but whole nations have combined in
unhesitating condemnation of our great dramatist,
as a sort of African nature, rich in beautiful
monsters&mdash;as a wild heath where islands of fertility
look the greener from the surrounding
waste, where the loveliest plants now shine out
among unsightly weeds, and now are choked by
their parasitic growth, so intertwined that we cannot
disentangle the weed without snapping the
flower?&mdash;In this statement I have had no reference
to the vulgar abuse of Voltaire, save as far
as his charges are coincident with the decisions of
Shakespeare's own commentators and (so they
would tell you) almost idolatrous admirers. The
true ground of the mistake lies in the confounding
mechanical regularity with organic form. The
form is mechanic, when on any given material we
impress a pre-determined form, not necessarily
arising out of the properties of the material;&mdash;as
when to a mass of wet clay we give whatever
shape we wish it to retain when hardened. The
organic form, on the other hand is innate; it
<pb n='055'/><anchor id='Pg055'/>
shapes, as it developes, itself from within, and the
fulness of its development is one and the same
with the perfection of its outward form. Such as
the life is, such is the form. Nature, the prime
genial artist, inexhaustible in diverse powers, is
equally inexhaustible in forms;&mdash;each exterior is
the physiognomy of the being within,&mdash;its true
image reflected and thrown out from the concave
mirror;&mdash;and even such is the appropriate excellence
of her chosen poet, of our own Shakespeare,&mdash;himself
a nature humanized, a genial
understanding directing self-consciously a power
and an implicit wisdom deeper even than our consciousness.
</p>

<p>
I greatly dislike beauties and selections in
general; but as proof positive of his unrivalled
excellence, I should like to try Shakespeare by
this criterion. Make out your amplest catalogue
of all the human faculties, as reason or the moral
law, the will, the feeling of the coincidence of the
two (a feeling <hi rend='italic'>sui generis et demonstratio demonstrationum</hi>)
called the conscience, the understanding
or prudence, wit, fancy, imagination, judgment,&mdash;and
then of the objects on which these are to be
employed, as the beauties, the terrors, and the
seeming caprices of nature, the realities and the
capabilities, that is, the actual and the ideal, of
the human mind, conceived as an individual or as
a social being, as in innocence or in guilt, in a
play-paradise, or in a war-field of temptation;&mdash;and
then compare with Shakespeare under each
of these heads all or any of the writers in prose
and verse that have ever lived! Who, that is
competent to judge, doubts the result?&mdash;And ask
your own hearts&mdash;ask your own common-sense&mdash;to
<pb n='056'/><anchor id='Pg056'/>
conceive the possibility of this man being&mdash;I
say not, the drunken savage of that wretched
sciolist, whom Frenchmen, to their shame, have
honoured before their elder and better worthies,&mdash;but
the anomalous, the wild, the irregular, genius
of our daily criticism! What! are we to have
miracles in sport?&mdash;Or, I speak reverently, does
God choose idiots by whom to convey divine
truths to man?

<head>Recapitulation, And Summary
Of the Characteristics of Shakespeare's Dramas.</head>

<p>
In lectures, of which amusement forms a large
part of the object, there are some peculiar difficulties.
The architect places his foundation out
of sight, and the musician tunes his instrument
before he makes his appearance; but the lecturer
has to try his chords in the presence of the assembly;
an operation not likely, indeed, to produce
much pleasure, but yet indispensably necessary to
a right understanding of the subject to be developed.
</p>

<p>
Poetry in essence is as familiar to barbarous as
to civilized nations. The Laplander and the savage
Indian are cheered by it as well as the inhabitants
of London and Paris;&mdash;its spirit takes up and
incorporates surrounding materials, as a plant
clothes itself with soil and climate, whilst it exhibits
the working of a vital principle within
independent of all accidental circumstances. And
to judge with fairness of an author's works, we
ought to distinguish what is inward and essential
from what is outward and circumstantial. It is
essential to poetry that it be simple, and appeal to
the elements and primary laws of our nature;
that it be sensuous, and by its imagery elicit truth
at a flash; that it be impassioned, and be able to
<pb n='058'/><anchor id='Pg058'/>
move our feelings and awaken our affections. In
comparing different poets with each other, we
should inquire which have brought into the fullest
play our imagination and our reason, or have
created the greatest excitement and produced the
completest harmony. If we consider great exquisiteness
of language and sweetness of metre alone,
it is impossible to deny to Pope the character of a
delightful writer; but whether he be a poet, must
depend upon our definition of the word; and, doubtless,
if everything that pleases be poetry, Pope's
satires and epistles must be poetry. This, I must
say, that poetry, as distinguished from other modes
of composition, does not rest in metre, and that it is
not poetry, if it make no appeal to our passions or
our imagination. One character belongs to all
true poets, that they write from a principle within,
not originating in any thing without; and that
the true poet's work in its form, its shapings, and
its modifications, is distinguished from all other
works that assume to belong to the class of poetry,
as a natural from an artificial flower, or as the
mimic garden of a child from an enamelled
meadow. In the former the flowers are broken
from their stems and stuck into the ground; they
are beautiful to the eye and fragrant to the sense,
but their colours soon fade, and their odour is
transient as the smile of the planter;&mdash;while the
meadow may be visited again and again with renewed
delight; its beauty is innate in the soil,
and its bloom is of the freshness of nature.
</p>

<p>
The next ground of critical judgment, and point
of comparison, will be as to how far a given poet
has been influenced by accidental circumstances.
As a living poet must surely write, not for the
<pb n='059'/><anchor id='Pg059'/>
ages past, but for that in which he lives, and those
which are to follow, it is on the one hand natural
that he should not violate, and on the other necessary
that he should not depend on, the mere
manners and modes of his day. See how little
does Shakespeare leave us to regret that he was
born in his particular age! The great æra in
modern times was what is called the Restoration
of Letters;&mdash;the ages preceding it are called the
dark ages; but it would be more wise, perhaps, to
call them the ages in which we were in the dark.
It is usually overlooked that the supposed dark
period was not universal, but partial and successive,
or alternate; that the dark age of England
was not the dark age of Italy, but that one country
was in its light and vigour, whilst another was
in its gloom and bondage. But no sooner had the
Reformation sounded through Europe like the
blast of an archangel's trumpet, than from king
to peasant there arose an enthusiasm for knowledge;
the discovery of a manuscript became the
subject of an embassy; Erasmus read by moonlight,
because he could not afford a torch, and
begged a penny, not for the love of charity, but
for the love of learning. The three great points
of attention were religion, morals, and taste; men
of genius, as well as men of learning, who in this
age need to be so widely distinguished, then alike
became copyists of the ancients; and this, indeed,
was the only way by which the taste of mankind
could be improved, or their understandings informed.
Whilst Dante imagined himself a humble
follower of Virgil, and Ariosto of Homer, they
were both unconscious of that greater power working
within them, which in many points carried
<pb n='060'/><anchor id='Pg060'/>
them beyond their supposed originals. All great
discoveries bear the stamp of the age in which
they are made;&mdash;hence we perceive the effects of
the purer religion of the moderns visible for the
most part in their lives; and in reading their
works we should not content ourselves with the
mere narratives of events long since passed, but
should learn to apply their maxims and conduct
to ourselves.
</p>

<p>
Having intimated that times and manners lend
their form and pressure to genius, let me once
more draw a slight parallel between the ancient
and modern stage,&mdash;the stages of Greece and of
England. The Greeks were polytheists; their
religion was local; almost the only object of all
their knowledge, art, and taste, was their gods;
and, accordingly, their productions were, if the
expression may be allowed, statuesque, whilst
those of the moderns are picturesque. The Greeks
reared a structure, which, in its parts, and as a
whole, filled the mind with the calm and elevated
impression of perfect beauty, and symmetrical proportion.
The moderns also produced a whole&mdash;a
more striking whole; but it was by blending
materials, and fusing the parts together. And as
the Pantheon is to York Minster or Westminster
Abbey, so is Sophocles compared with Shakespeare;
in the one a completeness, a satisfaction, an excellence,
on which the mind rests with complacency;
in the other a multitude of interlaced
materials, great and little, magnificent and mean,
accompanied, indeed, with the sense of a falling
short of perfection, and yet, at the same time, so
promising of our social and individual progression,
that we would not, if we could, exchange it for
<pb n='061'/><anchor id='Pg061'/>
that repose of the mind which dwells on the forms
of symmetry in the acquiescent admiration of
grace. This general characteristic of the ancient
and modern drama might be illustrated by a
parallel of the ancient and modern music;&mdash;the
one consisting of melody arising from a succession
only of pleasing sounds,&mdash;the modern embracing
harmony also, the result of combination, and the
effect of a whole.
</p>

<p>
I have said, and I say it again, that great as
was the genius of Shakespeare, his judgment was
at least equal to it. Of this any one will be convinced,
who attentively considers those points in
which the dramas of Greece and England differ,
from the dissimilitude of circumstances by which
each was modified and influenced. The Greek
stage had its origin in the ceremonies of a sacrifice,
such as of the goat to Bacchus, whom we
most erroneously regard as merely the jolly god of
wine;&mdash;for among the ancients he was venerable,
as the symbol of that power which acts without
our consciousness in the vital energies of nature&mdash;the
<hi rend='italic'>vinum mundi</hi>&mdash;as Apollo was that of the conscious
agency of our intellectual being. The
heroes of old, under the influences of this Bacchic
enthusiasm, performed more than human actions;
hence tales of the favourite champions soon passed
into dialogue. On the Greek stage the chorus
was always before the audience; the curtain was
never dropped, as we should say; and change of
place being therefore, in general, impossible, the
absurd notion of condemning it merely as improbable
in itself was never entertained by any one.
If we can believe ourselves at Thebes in one act,
we may believe ourselves at Athens in the next.
</p>

<pb n='062'/><anchor id='Pg062'/>

<p>
If a story lasts twenty-four hours or twenty-four
years, it is equally improbable. There seems to
be no just boundary but what the feelings prescribe.
But on the Greek stage, where the same
persons were perpetually before the audience,
great judgment was necessary in venturing on
any such change. The poets never, therefore,
attempted to impose on the senses by bringing
places to men, but they did bring men to places,
as in the well-known instance in the <hi rend='italic'>Eumenides</hi>,
where, during an evident retirement of the chorus
from the orchestra, the scene is changed to
Athens, and Orestes is first introduced in the
temple of Minerva, and the chorus of Furies come
in afterwards in pursuit of him.
</p>

<p>
In the Greek drama there were no formal divisions
into scenes and acts; there were no means,
therefore, of allowing for the necessary lapse of
time between one part of the dialogue and another,
and unity of time in a strict sense was, of course,
impossible. To overcome that difficulty of accounting
for time, which is effected on the modern
stage by dropping a curtain, the judgment and
great genius of the ancients supplied music and
measured motion, and with the lyric ode filled up
the vacuity. In the story of the <hi rend='italic'>Agamemnon</hi> of
Æschylus, the capture of Troy is supposed to be
announced by a fire lighted on the Asiatic shore,
and the transmission of the signal by successive
beacons to Mycenæ. The signal is first seen at
the 21st line, and the herald from Troy itself
enters at the 486th, and Agamemnon himself at
the 783rd line. But the practical absurdity of
this was not felt by the audience, who, in imagination
stretched minutes into hours, while they
<pb n='063'/><anchor id='Pg063'/>
listened to the lofty narrative odes of the chorus
which almost entirely filled up the interspace.
Another fact deserves attention here, namely, that
regularly on the Greek stage a drama, or acted
story, consisted in reality of three dramas, called
together a trilogy, and performed consecutively in
the course of one day. Now you may conceive a
tragedy of Shakespeare's as a trilogy connected in
one single representation. Divide <hi rend='italic'>Lear</hi> into three
parts, and each would be a play with the ancients;
or take the three Æschylean dramas of <hi rend='italic'>Agamemnon</hi>,
and divide them into, or call them, as many
acts, and they together would be one play. The
first act would comprise the usurpation of Ægisthus,
and the murder of Agamemnon; the second,
the revenge of Orestes, and the murder of his
mother; and the third, the penance and absolution
of Orestes;&mdash;occupying a period of twenty-two
years.
</p>

<p>
The stage in Shakespeare's time was a naked
room with a blanket for a curtain; but he made
it a field for monarchs. That law of unity, which
has its foundations, not in the factitious necessity
of custom, but in nature itself, the unity of feeling,
is everywhere and at all times observed by Shakespeare
in his plays. Read <hi rend='italic'>Romeo and Juliet</hi>;&mdash;all
is youth and spring;&mdash;youth with its follies, its
virtues, its precipitancies;&mdash;spring with its odours,
its flowers, and its transiency; it is one and the
same feeling that commences, goes through, and
ends the play. The old men, the Capulets and
Montagues, are not common old men; they have
an eagerness, a heartiness, a vehemence, the effect
of spring; with Romeo, his change of passion, his
sudden marriage, and his rash death, are all the
<pb n='064'/><anchor id='Pg064'/>
effects of youth;&mdash;whilst in Juliet love has all that
is tender and melancholy in the nightingale, all
that is voluptuous in the rose, with whatever is
sweet in the freshness of spring; but it ends with
a long deep sigh like the last breeze of the Italian
evening. This unity of feeling and character pervades
every drama of Shakespeare.
</p>

<p>
It seems to me that his plays are distinguished
from those of all other dramatic poets by the
following characteristics:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
1. Expectation in preference to surprise. It is
like the true reading of the passage&mdash;<q>God said,
Let there be light, and there was <emph>light</emph>;</q>&mdash;not,
there <emph>was</emph> light. As the feeling with which we
startle at a shooting star compared with that of
watching the sunrise at the pre-established moment,
such and so low is surprise compared with
expectation.
</p>

<p>
2. Signal adherence to the great law of nature,
that all opposites tend to attract and temper each
other. Passion in Shakespeare generally displays
libertinism, but involves morality; and if there
are exceptions to this, they are, independently of
their intrinsic value, all of them indicative of individual
character, and, like the farewell admonitions
of a parent, have an end beyond the parental
relation. Thus the Countess's beautiful precepts
to Bertram, by elevating her character, raise that
of Helena her favourite, and soften down the point
in her which Shakespeare does not mean us not to
see, but to see and to forgive, and at length to
justify. And so it is in Polonius, who is the personified
memory of wisdom no longer actually
possessed. This admirable character is always
misrepresented on the stage. Shakespeare never
<pb n='065'/><anchor id='Pg065'/>
intended to exhibit him as a buffoon; for although
it was natural that Hamlet&mdash;a young man of fire
and genius, detesting formality, and disliking
Polonius on political grounds, as imagining that
he had assisted his uncle in his usurpation&mdash;should
express himself satirically, yet this must not be
taken as exactly the poet's conception of him. In
Polonius a certain induration of character had
arisen from long habits of business; but take his
advice to Laertes, and Ophelia's reverence for his
memory, and we shall see that he was meant to be
represented as a statesman somewhat past his
faculties,&mdash;his recollections of life all full of wisdom,
and showing a knowledge of human nature,
whilst what immediately takes place before him,
and escapes from him, is indicative of weakness.
</p>

<p>
But as in Homer all the deities are in armour,
even Venus; so in Shakespeare all the characters
are strong. Hence real folly and dulness are
made by him the vehicles of wisdom. There is no
difficulty for one being a fool to imitate a fool;
but to be, remain, and speak like a wise man and
a great wit, and yet so as to give a vivid representation
of a veritable fool,&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>hic labor, hoc opus est</hi>.
A drunken constable is not uncommon, nor hard
to draw; but see and examine what goes to make
up a Dogberry.
</p>

<p>
3. Keeping at all times in the high road of life.
Shakespeare has no innocent adulteries, no interesting
incests, no virtuous vice;&mdash;he never renders
that amiable which religion and reason alike
teach us to detest, or clothes impurity in the garb
of virtue, like Beaumont and Fletcher, the Kotzebues
of the day. Shakespeare's fathers are
roused by ingratitude, his husbands stung by unfaithfulness;
<pb n='066'/><anchor id='Pg066'/>
in him, in short, the affections are
wounded in those points in which all may, nay,
must, feel. Let the morality of Shakespeare be
contrasted with that of the writers of his own, or
the succeeding age, or of those of the present day,
who boast their superiority in this respect. No
one can dispute that the result of such a comparison
is altogether in favour of Shakespeare;&mdash;even
the letters of women of high rank in his age were
often coarser than his writings. If he occasionally
disgusts a keen sense of delicacy, he never
injures the mind; he neither excites, nor flatters,
passion, in order to degrade the subject of it; he
does not use the faulty thing for a faulty purpose,
nor carries on warfare against virtue, by causing
wickedness to appear as no wickedness, through
the medium of a morbid sympathy with the unfortunate.
In Shakespeare vice never walks as in
twilight; nothing is purposely out of its place;&mdash;he
inverts not the order of nature and propriety,&mdash;does
not make every magistrate a drunkard or
glutton, nor every poor man meek, humane, and
temperate; he has no benevolent butchers, nor any
sentimental rat-catchers.
</p>

<p>
4. Independence of the dramatic interest on the
plot. The interest in the plot is always in fact on
account of the characters, not <hi rend='italic'>vice versa</hi>, as in
almost all other writers; the plot is a mere canvass
and no more. Hence arises the true justification
of the same stratagem being used in regard to
Benedict and Beatrice,&mdash;the vanity in each being
alike. Take away from the <hi rend='italic'>Much Ado about
Nothing</hi> all that which is not indispensable to the
plot, either as having little to do with it, or, at
best, like Dogberry and his comrades, forced into
<pb n='067'/><anchor id='Pg067'/>
the service, when any other less ingeniously
absurd watchmen and night-constables would have
answered the mere necessities of the action;&mdash;take
away Benedict, Beatrice, Dogberry, and the
reaction of the former on the character of Hero,&mdash;and
what will remain? In other writers the main
agent of the plot is always the prominent character;
in Shakespeare it is so, or is not so, as the
character is in itself calculated, or not calculated,
to form the plot. Don John is the main-spring of
the plot of this play; but he is merely shown and
then withdrawn.
</p>

<p>
5. Independence of the interest on the story as
the ground-work of the plot. Hence Shakespeare
never took the trouble of inventing stories. It
was enough for him to select from those that had
been already invented or recorded such as had one
or other, or both, of two recommendations, namely,
suitableness to his particular purpose, and their
being parts of popular tradition,&mdash;names of which
we had often heard, and of their fortunes, and as
to which all we wanted was, to see the man himself.
So it is just the man himself&mdash;the Lear,
the Shylock, the Richard&mdash;that Shakespeare
makes us for the first time acquainted with.
Omit the first scene in <hi rend='italic'>Lear</hi>, and yet everything
will remain; so the first and second scenes in
the <hi rend='italic'>Merchant of Venice</hi>. Indeed it is universally
true.
</p>

<p>
6. Interfusion of the lyrical&mdash;that which in its
very essence is poetical&mdash;not only with the dramatic,
as in the plays of Metastasio, where at the end
of the scene comes the <hi rend='italic'>aria</hi>
as the <emph>exit</emph> speech of
the character,&mdash;but also in and through the dramatic.
Songs in Shakespeare are introduced as songs
<pb n='068'/><anchor id='Pg068'/>
only, just as songs are in real life, beautifully as
some of them are characteristic of the person who
has sung or called for them, as Desdemona's
<q>Willow,</q> and Ophelia's wild snatches, and the
sweet carollings in <hi rend='italic'>As You Like It</hi>. But the
whole of the <hi rend='italic'>Midsummer Night's Dream</hi> is one
continued specimen of the dramatised lyrical.
And observe how exquisitely the dramatic of Hotspur;&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">Marry, and I'm glad on't with all my heart;</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">I'd rather be a kitten and cry&mdash;mew.</q> &amp;c.</l>
</lg>

<p>
melts away into the lyric of Mortimer;&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">I understand thy looks: that pretty Welsh</q></l>
<l>Which thou pourest down from these swelling heavens,</l>
<l><q rend="post">I am too perfect in,</q> &amp;c.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l><hi rend='italic'>Henry IV.</hi> part i. act iii, sc. 1.</l>
</lg>

<p>
7. The characters of the <hi rend='italic'>dramatis personæ</hi>, like
those in real life, are to be inferred by the reader;&mdash;they
are not told to him. And it is well worth
remarking that Shakespeare's characters, like those
in real life, are very commonly misunderstood, and
almost always understood by different persons in
different ways. The causes are the same in either
case. If you take only what the friends of the
character say, you may be deceived, and still more
so, if that which his enemies say; nay, even the
character himself sees himself through the medium
of his character, and not exactly as he is. Take
all together, not omitting a shrewd hint from the
clown or the fool, and perhaps your impression will
be right; and you may know whether you have in
fact discovered the poet's own idea, by all the
speeches receiving light from it, and attesting its
reality by reflecting it.
</p>

<pb n='069'/><anchor id='Pg069'/>

<p>
Lastly, in Shakespeare the heterogeneous is
united, as it is in nature. You must not suppose
a pressure or passion always acting on or in the
character!&mdash;passion in Shakespeare is that by
which the individual is distinguished from others,
not that which makes a different kind of him.
Shakespeare followed the main march of the
human affections. He entered into no analysis of
the passions or faiths of men, but assured himself
that such and such passions and faiths were
grounded in our common nature, and not in the
mere accidents of ignorance or disease. This is an
important consideration, and constitutes our Shakespeare
the morning star, the guide and the pioneer,
of true philosophy.

<head>Outline Of An Introductory Lecture Upon Shakespeare.</head>

<p>
Of that species of writing termed tragi-comedy,
much has been produced and doomed to the
shelf. Shakespeare's comic are continually reacting
upon his tragic characters. Lear, wandering
amidst the tempest, has all his feelings of distress
increased by the overflowings of the wild wit
of the Fool, as vinegar poured upon wounds exacerbates
their pain. Thus, even his comic humour
tends to the development of tragic passion.
</p>

<p>
The next characteristic of Shakespeare is his
keeping at all times in the high road of life, &amp;c.
Another evidence of his exquisite judgment is,
that he seizes hold of popular tales; <hi rend='italic'>Lear</hi> and the
<hi rend='italic'>Merchant of Venice</hi> were popular tales, but are so
excellently managed, that both are the representations
of men in all countries and of all times.
</p>

<p>
His dramas do not arise absolutely out of some
one extraordinary circumstance, the scenes may
stand independently of any such one connecting
incident, as faithful representations of men and
manners. In his mode of drawing characters
there are no pompous descriptions of a man by
himself; his character is to be drawn, as in real
life, from the whole course of the play, or out of
the mouths of his enemies or friends. This may
<pb n='072'/><anchor id='Pg072'/>
be exemplified in Polonius, whose character has
been often misrepresented. Shakespeare never
intended him for a buffoon, &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
Another excellence of Shakespeare, in which no
writer equals him, is in the language of nature.
So correct is it, that we can see ourselves in every
page. The style and manner have also that
felicity, that not a sentence can be read, without
its being discovered if it is Shakespearian. In
observation of living characters&mdash;of landlords and
postilions&mdash;Fielding has great excellence; but in
drawing from his own heart, and depicting that
species of character, which no observation could
teach, he failed in comparison with Richardson,
who perpetually places himself, as it were, in a
day-dream. Shakespeare excels in both. Witness
the accuracy of character in Juliet's name; while
for the great characters of Iago, Othello, Hamlet,
Richard III., to which he could never have seen
anything similar, he seems invariably to have
asked himself&mdash;How should I act or speak in such
circumstances? His comic characters are also
peculiar. A drunken constable was not uncommon;
but he makes folly a vehicle for wit, as
in Dogberry: everything is a <hi rend='italic'>sub-stratum</hi> on which
his genius can erect the mightiest superstructure.
</p>

<p>
To distinguish that which is legitimate in
Shakespeare from what does not belong to him,
we must observe his varied images symbolical of
novel truth, thrusting by, and seeming to trip up
each other, from an impetuosity of thought, producing
a flowing metre, and seldom closing with
the line. In <hi rend='italic'>Pericles</hi>, a play written fifty years
before, but altered by Shakespeare, his additions
may be recognised to half a line, from the metre,
<pb n='073'/><anchor id='Pg073'/>
which has the same perfection in the flowing continuity
of interchangeable metrical pauses in his
earliest plays, as in <hi rend='italic'>Love's Labour's Lost</hi>.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, contrast his <emph>morality</emph> with the writers of
his own or of the succeeding age, &amp;c. If a man
speak injuriously of our friend, our vindication of
him is naturally warm. Shakespeare has been
accused of profaneness. I for my part have
acquired from perusal of him, a habit of looking
into my own heart, and am confident that Shakespeare
is an author of all others the most calculated
to make his readers better as well as wiser.
</p>

<p>
Shakespeare, possessed of wit, humour, fancy,
and imagination, built up an outward world from
the stores within his mind, as the bee finds a hive
from a thousand sweets gathered from a thousand
flowers. He was not only a great poet but a great
philosopher. Richard III., Iago, and Falstaff are
men who reverse the order of things, who place
intellect at the head, whereas it ought to follow,
like Geometry, to prove and to confirm. No man,
either hero or saint, ever acted from an unmixed
motive; for let him do what he will rightly, still
Conscience whispers <q>it is your duty.</q> Richard,
laughing at conscience and sneering at religion,
felt a confidence in his intellect, which urged him
to commit the most horrid crimes, because he felt
himself, although inferior in form and shape,
superior to those around him; he felt he possessed
a power which they had not. Iago, on the same
principle, conscious of superior intellect, gave
scope to his envy, and hesitated not to ruin a
gallant, open, and generous friend in the moment
<pb n='074'/><anchor id='Pg074'/>
of felicity, because he was not promoted as he expected.
Othello was superior in place, but Iago
felt him to be inferior in intellect, and, unrestrained
by conscience, trampled upon him. Falstaff,
not a degraded man of genius, like Burns,
but a man of degraded genius, with the same
consciousness of superiority to his companions,
fastened himself on a young Prince, to prove how
much his influence on an heir-apparent would
exceed that of a statesman. With this view he
hesitated not to adopt the most contemptible of all
characters, that of an open and professed liar:
even his sensuality was subservient to his intellect:
for he appeared to drink sack, that he might have
occasion to show off his wit. One thing, however,
worthy of observation, is the perpetual contrast of
labour in Falstaff to produce wit, with the ease
with which Prince Henry parries his shafts; and
the final contempt which such a character deserves
and receives from the young king, when Falstaff
exhibits the struggle of inward determination with
an outward show of humility.

<head>Order Of Shakespeare's Plays.</head>

<p>
Various attempts have been made to arrange
the plays of Shakespeare, each according to
its priority in time, by proofs derived from external
documents. How unsuccessful these attempts have
been might easily be shewn, not only from the
widely different results arrived at by men, all
deeply versed in the black-letter books, old plays,
pamphlets, manuscript records, and catalogues of
that age, but also from the fallacious and unsatisfactory
nature of the facts and assumptions on
which the evidence rests. In that age, when the
press was chiefly occupied with controversial or
practical divinity,&mdash;when the law, the Church, and
the State engrossed all honour and respectability,&mdash;when
a degree of disgrace, <hi rend='italic'>levior quædam infamiæ
macula</hi>, was attached to the publication of poetry,
and even to have sported with the Muse, as a
private relaxation, was supposed to be&mdash;a venial
fault, indeed, yet&mdash;something beneath the gravity
of a wise man,&mdash;when the professed poets were so
poor, that the very expenses of the press demanded
the liberality of some wealthy individual, so that
two-thirds of Spenser's poetic works, and those
most highly praised by his learned admirers and
friends, remained for many years in manuscript,
and in manuscript perished,&mdash;when the amateurs
of the stage were comparatively few, and therefore
for the greater part more or less known to each
<pb n='076'/><anchor id='Pg076'/>
other,&mdash;when we know that the plays of Shakespeare,
both during and after his life, were the
property of the stage, and published by the
players, doubtless according to their notions of
acceptability with the visitants of the theatre,&mdash;in
such an age, and under such circumstances, can an
allusion or reference to any drama or poem in the
publication of a contemporary be received as conclusive
evidence, that such drama or poem had at
that time been published? Or, further, can the
priority of publication itself prove anything in
favour of actually prior composition?
</p>

<p>
We are tolerably certain, indeed, that the <hi rend='italic'>Venus
and Adonis</hi>, and the <hi rend='italic'>Rape of Lucrece</hi>, were his two
earliest poems, and though not printed until 1593,
in the twenty-ninth year of his age, yet there can
be little doubt that they had remained by him in
manuscript many years. For Mr. Malone has
made it highly probable that he had commenced
as a writer for the stage in 1591, when he was
twenty-seven years old, and Shakespeare himself
assures us that the <hi rend='italic'>Venus and Adonis</hi> was the first
heir of his invention.
</p>

<p>
Baffled, then, in the attempt to derive any satisfaction
from outward documents, we may easily
stand excused if we turn our researches towards
the internal evidences furnished by the writings
themselves, with no other positive <hi rend='italic'>data</hi> than the
known facts that the <hi rend='italic'>Venus and Adonis</hi> was printed
in 1593, the <hi rend='italic'>Rape of Lucrece</hi> in 1594, and that the
<hi rend='italic'>Romeo and Juliet</hi> had appeared in 1595,&mdash;and
with no other presumptions than that the poems,
his very first productions, were written many
years earlier&mdash;(for who can believe that Shakespeare
could have remained to his twenty-ninth or
<pb n='077'/><anchor id='Pg077'/>
thirtieth year without attempting poetic composition
of any kind?),&mdash;and that between these and
<hi rend='italic'>Romeo and Juliet</hi> there had intervened one or two
other dramas, or the chief materials, at least of
them, although they may very possibly have
appeared after the success of the <hi rend='italic'>Romeo and Juliet</hi>,
and some other circumstances, had given the poet
an authority with the proprietors, and created a
prepossession in his favour with the theatrical
audiences.

<p>
I think Shakespeare's earliest dramatic attempt&mdash;perhaps
even prior in conception to the <hi rend='italic'>Venus
and Adonis</hi>, and planned before he left Stratford&mdash;was
<hi rend='italic'>Love's Labour's Lost</hi>. Shortly afterwards I
suppose <hi rend='italic'>Pericles</hi> and certain
scenes in <hi rend='italic'>Jeronymo</hi> to
have been produced; and in the same epoch, I
place the <hi rend='italic'>Winter's Tale</hi>
and <hi rend='italic'>Cymbeline</hi>, differing
from the <hi rend='italic'>Pericles</hi> by the
entire <hi rend='italic'>rifacimento</hi> of it,
when Shakespeare's celebrity as poet, and his interest,
no less than his influence, as manager,
enabled him to bring forward the laid-by labours
of his youth. The example of <hi rend='italic'>Titus Andronicus</hi>,
which, as well as <hi rend='italic'>Jeronymo</hi>, was most popular in
Shakespeare's first epoch, had led the young
dramatist to the lawless mixture of dates and
manners. In this same epoch I should place the
<hi rend='italic'>Comedy of Errors</hi>, remarkable as being the only
specimen of poetical farce in our language, that is,
intentionally such; so that all the distinct kinds
of drama, which might be educed <hi rend='italic'>a priori</hi>, have
their representatives in Shakespeare's works. I
say intentionally such; for many of Beaumont
and Fletcher's plays, and the greater part of Ben
Jonson's comedies, are farce plots. I add <hi rend='italic'>All's
Well that Ends Well</hi>, originally intended as the
counterpart of <hi rend='italic'>Love's Labour's Lost</hi>,
<hi rend='italic'>Taming of the Shrew</hi>,

<head>Notes On The <q>Tempest.</q></head>

<p>
There is a sort of improbability with which
we are shocked in dramatic representation,
not less than in a narrative of real life. Consequently,
there must be rules respecting it; and as
rules are nothing but means to an end previously
ascertained&mdash;(inattention to which simple truth
has been the occasion of all the pedantry of the
French school),&mdash;we must first determine what the
immediate end or object of the drama is. And
here, as I have previously remarked, I find two
extremes of critical decision;&mdash;the French, which
evidently presupposes that a perfect delusion is to be
aimed at,&mdash;an opinion which needs no fresh confutation;
and the exact opposite to it, brought forward
by Dr. Johnson, who supposes the auditors
throughout in the full reflective knowledge of the
contrary. In evincing the impossibility of delusion,
he makes no sufficient allowance for an intermediate
state, which I have before distinguished
by the term illusion, and have attempted to illustrate
its quality and character by reference to our
mental state when dreaming. In both cases we
simply do not judge the imagery to be unreal;
there is a negative reality, and no more. Whatever,
therefore, tends to prevent the mind from
placing itself, or being placed, gradually in that
state in which the images have such negative
reality for the auditor, destroys this illusion, and
is dramatically improbable.
</p>

<pb n='084'/><anchor id='Pg084'/>

<p>
Now, the production of this effect&mdash;a sense of
improbability&mdash;will depend on the degree of excitement
in which the mind is supposed to be.
Many things would be intolerable in the first
scene of a play, that would not at all interrupt our
enjoyment in the height of the interest, when the
narrow cockpit may be made to hold
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">The vasty field of France, or we may cram</q></l>
<l>Within its wooden O, the very casques,</l>
<l><q rend="post">That did affright the air at Agincourt.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
Again, on the other hand, many obvious improbabilities
will be endured, as belonging to the
groundwork of the story rather than to the drama
itself, in the first scenes, which would disturb or
disentrance us from all illusion in the acme of our
excitement; as for instance, Lear's division of his
kingdom, and the banishment of Cordelia.
</p>

<p>
But, although the other excellences of the drama
besides this dramatic probability, as unity of interest,
with distinctness and subordination of the
characters, and appropriateness of style, are all, so
far as they tend to increase the inward excitement,
means towards accomplishing the chief end, that
of producing and supporting this willing illusion,&mdash;yet
they do not on that account cease to be ends
themselves; and we must remember that, as such,
they carry their own justification with them, as
long as they do not contravene or interrupt the
total illusion. It is not even always, or of necessity,
an objection to them, that they prevent the
illusion from rising to as great a height as it
might otherwise have attained;&mdash;it is enough that
they are simply compatible with as high a degree
of it as is requisite for the purpose. Nay, upon
<pb n='085'/><anchor id='Pg085'/>
particular occasions, a palpable improbability may
be hazarded by a great genius for the express purpose
of keeping down the interest of a merely instrumental
scene, which would otherwise make too
great an impression for the harmony of the entire
illusion. Had the panorama been invented in the
time of Pope Leo X., Raffael would still, I doubt
not, have smiled in contempt at the regret, that
the broom twigs and scrubby bushes at the back of
some of his grand pictures were not as probable
trees as those in the exhibition.
</p>

<p>
The <hi rend='italic'>Tempest</hi> is a specimen of the purely romantic
drama, in which the interest is not historical,
or dependent upon fidelity of portraiture,
or the natural connection of events, but is a birth
of the imagination, and rests only upon the coaptation
and union of the elements granted to, or
assumed by, the poet. It is a species of drama
which owes no allegiance to time or space, and in
which, therefore, errors of chronology and geography&mdash;no
mortal sins in any species&mdash;are venial
faults, and count for nothing. It addresses itself
entirely to the imaginative faculty; and although
the illusion may be assisted by the effect on the
senses of the complicated scenery and decorations
of modern times, yet this sort of assistance is
dangerous. For the principal and only genuine
excitement ought to come from within&mdash;from the
moved and sympathetic imagination; whereas,
where so much is addressed to the mere external
senses of seeing and bearing, the spiritual vision
is apt to languish, and the attraction from without
will withdraw the mind from the proper and only
legitimate interest which is intended to spring
from within.
</p>

<pb n='086'/><anchor id='Pg086'/>

<p>
The romance opens with a busy scene admirably
appropriate to the kind of drama, and giving, as
it were, the key-note to the whole harmony. It
prepares and initiates the excitement required for
the entire piece, and yet does not demand anything
from the spectators, which their previous
habits had not fitted them to understand. It is
the bustle of a tempest, from which the real
horrors are abstracted;&mdash;therefore it is poetical,
though not in strictness natural&mdash;(the distinction
to which I have so often alluded)&mdash;and is purposely
restrained from concentering the interest
on itself, but used merely as an induction or tuning
for what is to follow.
</p>

<p>
In the second scene, Prospero's speeches, till the
entrance of Ariel, contain the finest example I remember
of retrospective narration for the purpose
of exciting immediate interest, and putting the
audience in possession of all the information necessary
for the understanding of the plot. Observe,
too, the perfect probability of the moment chosen
by Prospero (the very Shakespeare himself, as it
were, of the tempest) to open out the truth to his
daughter, his own romantic bearing, and how
completely anything that might have been disagreeable
to us in the magician, is reconciled and
shaded in the humanity and natural feelings of the
father. In the very first speech of Miranda, the
simplicity and tenderness of her character are at
once laid open;&mdash;it would have been lost in direct
contact with the agitation of the first scene. The
opinion once prevailed, but happily is now abandoned,
that Fletcher alone wrote for women;&mdash;the
truth is, that with very few, and those partial exceptions,
the female characters in the plays of
<pb n='087'/><anchor id='Pg087'/>
Beaumont and Fletcher are, when of the light
kind, not decent; when heroic, complete viragos.
But in Shakespeare all the elements of womanhood
are holy, and there is the sweet yet dignified
feeling of all that <emph>continuates</emph> society, as sense of
ancestry and of sex, with a purity unassailable by
sophistry, because it rests not in the analytic processes,
but in that sane equipoise of the faculties,
during which the feelings are representative of all
past experience,&mdash;not of the individual only, but of
all those by whom she has been educated, and
their predecessors, even up to the first mother that
lived. Shakespeare saw that the want of prominence,
which Pope notices for sarcasm, was the
blessed beauty of the woman's character, and knew
that it arose not from any deficiency, but from the
more exquisite harmony of all the parts of the
moral being constituing one living total of head
and heart. He has drawn it, indeed, in all its distinctive
energies of faith, patience, constancy, fortitude,&mdash;shown
in all of them as following the
heart, which gives its results by a nice tact and
happy intuition, without the intervention of the
discursive faculty, sees all things in and by the
light of the affections, and errs, if it ever err, in
the exaggerations of love alone. In all the Shakespearian
women there is essentially the same
foundation and principle; the distinct individuality
and variety are merely the result of modification
of circumstances, whether in Miranda the
maiden, in Imogen the wife, or in Katherine the
queen.
</p>

<p>
But to return. The appearance and characters
of the super or ultra natural servants are finely
contrasted. Ariel has in everything the airy tint
<pb n='088'/><anchor id='Pg088'/>
which gives the name; and it is worthy of remark
that Miranda is never directly brought into comparison
with Ariel, lest the natural and human of
the one and the supernatural of the other should
tend to neutralise each other; Caliban, on the
other hand, is all earth, all condensed and gross in
feelings and images; he has the dawnings of
understanding without reason or the moral sense,
and in him, as in some brute animals, this advance
to the intellectual faculties, without the moral sense,
is marked by the appearance of vice. For it is in
the primacy of the moral being only that man is
truly human; in his intellectual powers he is certainly
approached by the brutes, and, man's whole
system duly considered, those powers cannot be
considered other than means to an end&mdash;that is,
to morality.
</p>

<p>
In this scene, as it proceeds, is displayed the
impression made by Ferdinand and Miranda on
each other; it is love at first sight;&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 7">... <q rend="pre">At the first sight</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">They have chang'd eyes;</q>&mdash;</l>
</lg>

<p>
and it appears to me, that in all cases of real love,
it is at one moment that it takes place. That moment
may have been prepared by previous esteem,
admiration, or even affection,&mdash;yet love seems to
require a momentary act of volition, by which a
tacit bond of devotion is imposed,&mdash;a bond not to
be thereafter broken without violating what should
be sacred in our nature. How finely is the true
Shakespearian scene contrasted with Dryden's
vulgar alteration of it, in which a mere ludicrous
psychological experiment, as it were, is tried&mdash;displaying
nothing but indelicacy without passion.
</p>

<pb n='089'/><anchor id='Pg089'/>

<p>
Prospero's interruption of the courtship has often
seemed to me to have had no sufficient motive;
still, his alleged reason&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 6">... <q rend="pre">Lest too light winning</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">Make the prize light</q>&mdash;</l>
</lg>

<p>
is enough for the ethereal connections of the romantic
imagination, although it would not be so
for the historical. The whole courting scene, indeed,
in the beginning of the third act, between
the lovers, is a masterpiece; and the first dawn of
disobedience in the mind of Miranda to the command
of her father is very finely drawn, so as to
seem the working of the Scriptural command&mdash;<q>Thou
shalt leave father and mother,</q> &amp;c. Oh!
with what exquisite purity this scene is conceived
and executed! Shakespeare may sometimes be
gross, but I boldly say that he is always moral and
modest. Alas! in this our day, decency of
manners is preserved at the expense of morality
of heart, and delicacies for vice are allowed, whilst
grossness against it is hypocritically, or at least
morbidly, condemned.
</p>

<p>
In this play are admirably sketched the vices
generally accompanying a low degree of civilisation;
and in the first scene of the second act
Shakespeare has, as in many other places, shown
the tendency in bad men to indulge in scorn and
contemptuous expressions as a mode of getting rid
of their own uneasy feelings of inferiority to the
good, and also, by making the good ridiculous, of
rendering the transition of others to wickedness
easy. Shakespeare never puts habitual scorn into
the mouths of other than bad men, as here in the
instances of Antonio and Sebastian. The scene of
<pb n='090'/><anchor id='Pg090'/>
the intended assassination of Alonzo and Gonzalo
is an exact counterpart of the scene between Macbeth
and his lady, only pitched in a lower key
throughout, as designed to be frustrated and concealed,
and exhibiting the same profound management
in the manner of familiarising a mind, not
immediately recipient, to the suggestion of guilt,
by associating the proposed crime with something
ludicrous or out of place,&mdash;something not habitually
matter of reverence. By this kind of sophistry
the imagination and fancy are first bribed to
contemplate the suggested act, and at length to
become acquainted with it. Observe how the
effect of this scene is heightened by contrast with
another counterpart of it in low life,&mdash;that between
the conspirators Stephano, Caliban, and
Trinculo in the second scene of the third act, in
which there are the same essential characteristics.
</p>

<p>
In this play, and in this scene of it, are also
shown the springs of the vulgar in politics,&mdash;of
that kind of politics which is inwoven with human
nature. In his treatment of this subject, wherever
it occurs, Shakespeare is quite peculiar. In other
writers we find the particular opinions of the individual;
in Massinger it is rank republicanism; in
Beaumont and Fletcher even <hi rend='italic'>jure divino</hi> principles
are carried to excess;&mdash;but Shakespeare never
promulgates any party tenets. He is always the
philosopher and the moralist, but at the same time
with a profound veneration for all the established
institutions of society, and for those classes which
form the permanent elements of the State,&mdash;especially
never introducing a professional character,
as such, otherwise than as respectable. If he must
have any name, he should be styled a philosophical
<pb n='091'/><anchor id='Pg091'/>
aristocrat, delighting in those hereditary institutions
which have a tendency to bind one age to
another, and in that distinction of ranks, of which,
although few may be in possession, all enjoy the
advantages. Hence, again, you will observe the
good nature with which he seems always to make
sport with the passions and follies of a mob, as
with an irrational animal. He is never angry
with it, but hugely content with holding up its
absurdities to its face; and sometimes you may
trace a tone of almost affectionate superiority,
something like that in which a father speaks of
the rogueries of a child. See the good-humoured
way in which he describes Stephano passing from
the most licentious freedom to absolute despotism
over Trinculo and Caliban. The truth is, Shakespeare's
characters are all <hi rend='italic'>genera</hi> intensely individualised;
the results of meditation, of which
observation supplied the drapery and the colours
necessary to combine them with each other. He
had virtually surveyed all the great component
powers and impulses of human nature,&mdash;had seen
that their different combinations and subordinations
were in fact the individualisers of men, and
showed how their harmony was produced by reciprocal
disproportions of excess or deficiency.
The language in which these truths are expressed
was not drawn from any set fashion, but from the
profoundest depths of his moral being, and is
therefore for all ages.

<head><q>Love's Labour's Lost.</q></head>

<p>
The characters in this play are either impersonated
out of Shakespeare's own multiformity
by imaginative self-position, or out of such
as a country town and schoolboy's observation
might supply,&mdash;the curate, the schoolmaster, the
Armado (who even in my time was not extinct in
the cheaper inns of North Wales), and so on. The
satire is chiefly on follies of words. Biron and
Rosaline are evidently the pre-existent state of
Benedict and Beatrice, and so, perhaps, is Boyet
of Lafeu, and Costard of the tapster in <hi rend='italic'>Measure
for Measure</hi>; and the frequency of the rhymes,
the sweetness as well as the smoothness of the
metre, and the number of acute and fancifully
illustrated aphorisms, are all as they ought to be
in a poet's youth. True genius begins by generalising
and condensing; it ends in realising and expanding.
It first collects the seeds.
</p>

<p>
Yet, if this juvenile drama had been the only
one extant of our Shakespeare, and we possessed
the tradition only of his riper works, or accounts
of them in writers who had not even mentioned
this play,&mdash;how many of Shakespeare's characteristic
features might we not still have discovered in
<hi rend='italic'>Love's Labour's Lost</hi>, though as in a portrait taken
of him in his boyhood.
</p>

<p>
I can never sufficiently admire the wonderful
activity of thought throughout the whole of the
first scene of the play, rendered natural, as it is,
<pb n='094'/><anchor id='Pg094'/>
by the choice of the characters, and the whimsical
determination on which the drama is founded. A
whimsical determination certainly;&mdash;yet not altogether
so very improbable to those who are conversant
in the history of the middle ages, with
their Courts of Love, and all that lighter drapery
of chivalry, which engaged even mighty kings
with a sort of serio-comic interest, and may well
be supposed to have occupied more completely the
smaller princes, at a time when the noble's or
prince's court contained the only theatre of the
domain or principality. This sort of story, too,
was admirably suited to Shakespeare's times, when
the English court was still the foster-mother of the
state and the muses; and when, in consequence,
the courtiers, and men of rank and fashion, affected
a display of wit, point, and sententious observation,
that would be deemed intolerable at present,&mdash;but
in which a hundred years of controversy, involving
every great political, and every dear domestic,
interest, had trained all but the lowest classes to
participate. Add to this the very style of the sermons
of the time, and the eagerness of the Protestants
to distinguish themselves by long and
frequent preaching, and it will be found that, from
the reign of Henry VIII. to the abdication of
James II. no country ever received such a national
education as England.
</p>

<p>
Hence the comic matter chosen in the first instance
is a ridiculous imitation or apery of this
constant striving after logical precision and subtle
opposition of thoughts, together with a making
the most of every conception or image, by expressing
it under the least expected property belonging
to it, and this, again, rendered specially absurd by
<pb n='095'/><anchor id='Pg095'/>
being applied to the most current subjects and
occurrences. The phrases and modes of combination
in argument were caught by the most ignorant
from the custom of the age, and their ridiculous
misapplication of them is most amusingly exhibited
in Costard; whilst examples suited only to the
gravest propositions and impersonations, or apostrophes
to abstract thoughts impersonated, which
are in fact the natural language only of the most
vehement agitations of the mind, are adopted by
the coxcombry of Armado as mere artifices of
ornament.
</p>

<p>
The same kind of intellectual action is exhibited
in a more serious and elevated strain in many
other parts of this play. Biron's speech at the
end of the Fourth Act is an excellent specimen of
it. It is logic clothed in rhetoric;&mdash;but observe
how Shakespeare, in his two-fold being of poet
and philosopher, avails himself of it to convey
profound truths in the most lively images,&mdash;the
whole remaining faithful to the character supposed
to utter the lines, and the expressions themselves
constituting a further development of that
character:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">Other slow arts entirely keep the brain:</q></l>
<l>And therefore finding barren practisers,</l>
<l>Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil:</l>
<l>But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,</l>
<l>Lives not alone immured in the brain;</l>
<l>But, with the motion of all elements,</l>
<l>Courses as swift as thought in every power;</l>
<l>And gives to every power a double power,</l>
<l>Above their functions and their offices.</l>
<l>It adds a precious seeing to the eye,</l>
<l>A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind;</l>
<l>A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,</l>
<l>When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd:</l>
<l>Love's feeling is more soft and sensible,</l>
<l>Than are the tender horns of cockled snails;</l>
<pb n='096'/><anchor id='Pg096'/>
<l>Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste;</l>
<l>For valour, is not love a Hercules,</l>
<l>Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?</l>
<l>Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical,</l>
<l>As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair;</l>
<l>And when love speaks, the voice of all the gods</l>
<l>Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.</l>
<l>Never durst poet touch a pen to write,</l>
<l>Until his ink were tempered with love's sighs;</l>
<l>Oh, then his lines would ravish savage ears,</l>
<l>And plant in tyrants mild humility.</l>
<l>From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:</l>
<l>They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;</l>
<l>They are the books, the arts, the academes,</l>
<l>That show, contain, and nourish all the world;</l>
<l>Else, none at all in aught proves excellent;</l>
<l>Then fools you were these women to forswear;</l>
<l>Or, keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.</l>
<l>For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love;</l>
<l>Or for love's sake, a word that loves all men;</l>
<l>Or for men's sake, the authors of these women;</l>
<l>Or women's sake, by whom we men are men;</l>
<l>Let us once lose our oaths, to find ourselves,</l>
<l>Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths:</l>
<l>It is religion to be thus forsworn:</l>
<l>For charity itself fulfils the law:</l>
<l><q rend="post">And who can sever love from charity?</q>&mdash;</l>
</lg>

<p>
This is quite a study;&mdash;sometimes you see this
youthful god of poetry connecting disparate
thoughts purely by means of resemblances in the
words expressing them,&mdash;a thing in character in
lighter comedy, especially of that kind in which
Shakespeare delights, namely, the purposed display
of wit, though sometimes too, disfiguring his
graver scenes;&mdash;but more often you may see him
doubling the natural connection or order of logical
consequence in the thoughts by the introduction
of an artificial and sought for resemblance in the
words, as, for instance, in the third line of the
play,&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q>And then grace us in the disgrace of death;</q>&mdash;</l>
</lg>

<p>
this being a figure often having its force and propriety,
as justified by the law of passion, which,
<pb n='097'/><anchor id='Pg097'/>
inducing in the mind an unusual activity, seeks
for means to waste its superfluity,&mdash;when in the
highest degree&mdash;in lyric repetitions and sublime
tautology&mdash;<q>At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay
down; at her feet he bowed, he fell; where he
bowed, there he fell down dead,</q>&mdash;and, in lower
degrees, in making the words themselves the subjects
and materials of that surplus action, and for
the same cause that agitates our limbs, and forces
our very gestures into a tempest in states of high
excitement.
</p>

<p>
The mere style of narration in <hi rend='italic'>Love's Labour's
Lost</hi>, like that of Ægeon in the first scene of the
<hi rend='italic'>Comedy of Errors</hi>, and of the Captain in the
second scene of <hi rend='italic'>Macbeth</hi>, seems imitated with its
defects and its beauties from Sir Philip Sidney;
whose <hi rend='italic'>Arcadia</hi>, though not then published, was
already well known in manuscript copies, and
could hardly have escaped the notice and admiration
of Shakespeare as the friend and client of the
Earl of Southampton. The chief defect consists
in the parentheses and parenthetic thoughts and
descriptions, suited neither to the passion of the
speaker, nor the purpose of the person to whom
the information is to be given, but manifestly betraying
the author himself,&mdash;not by way of continuous
undersong, but&mdash;palpably, and so as to
show themselves addressed to the general reader.
However, it is not unimportant to notice how
strong a presumption the diction and allusions of
this play afford, that, though Shakespeare's acquirements
in the dead languages might not be
such as we suppose in a learned education, his
habits had, nevertheless, been scholastic, and those
of a student. For a young author's first work
<pb n='098'/><anchor id='Pg098'/>
almost always bespeaks his recent pursuits, and
his first observations of life are either drawn from
the immediate employments of his youth, and from
the characters and images most deeply impressed
on his mind in the situations in which those employments
had placed him;&mdash;or else they are fixed
on such objects and occurrences in the world, as
are easily connected with, and seem to bear upon,
his studies and the hitherto exclusive subjects of
his meditation. Just as Ben Jonson, who applied
himself to the drama after having served in
Flanders, fills his earliest plays with true or pretended
soldiers, the wrongs and neglects of the
former, and the absurd boasts and knavery of
their counterfeits. So Lessing's first comedies are
placed in the universities, and consist of events
and characters conceivable in an academic life.
</p>

<p>
I will only further remark the sweet and tempered
gravity, with which Shakespeare in the end
draws the only fitting moral which such a drama
afforded. Here Rosaline rises up to the full
height of Beatrice:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre"><hi rend='italic'>Ros.</hi> Oft have I heard of you, my lord Biron,</q></l>
<l>Before I saw you: and the world's large tongue</l>

<l>Which you on all estates will execute</l>
<l>That lie within the mercy of your wit:</l>
<l>To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,</l>
<l>And therewithal, to win me, if you please</l>
<l>(Without the which I am not to be won),</l>
<l>You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day</l>
<l>Visit the speechless sick, and still converse</l>
<l>With groaning wretches; and your talk shall be,</l>
<l>With all the fierce endeavour of your wit,</l>
<l>To enforce the pained impotent to smile.</l>

There can be no doubt, indeed, about the propriety
of expunging this speech of Rosaline's; it soils
the very page that retains it. But I do not agree
with Warburton and others in striking out the
preceding line also. It is quite in Biron's character;
and Rosaline, not answering it immediately,
Dumain takes up the question for him,
and, after he and Longaville are answered, Biron,
with evident propriety, says:&mdash;

<p>
There is no authority for any alteration;&mdash;but
I never can help feeling how great an improvement
it would be, if the two former of
Hermia's exclamations were omitted;&mdash;the third
and only appropriate one would then become a
beauty, and most natural.

</lg>

<p>
I am convinced that Shakespeare availed himself
of the title of this play in his own mind, and
worked upon it as a dream throughout, but especially,
and perhaps unpleasingly, in this broad
determination of ungrateful treachery in Helena,
so undisguisedly avowed to herself, and this, too,
after the witty cool philosophising that precedes.
The act itself is natural, and the resolve so to act
is, I fear, likewise too true a picture of the lax
hold which principles have on a woman's heart,
when opposed to, or even separated from, passion
and inclination. For women are less hypocrites
to their own minds than men are, because in
general they feel less proportionate abhorrence of
moral evil in and for itself, and more of its outward
<pb n='102'/><anchor id='Pg102'/>
consequences, as detection and loss of character,
than men,&mdash;their natures being almost
wholly extroitive. Still, however just in itself,
the representation of this is not poetical; we
shrink from it, and cannot harmonise it with the
ideal.

<l>Spondee, - - = <hi rend='italic'>Gōd spāke</hi>.</l>
</lg>

<p>
The paucity of spondees in single words in English,
and indeed in the modern languages in general,
<pb n='103'/><anchor id='Pg103'/>
makes perhaps the greatest distinction, metrically
considered, between them and the Greek and
Latin.
</p>

<head><q>Comedy Of Errors.</q></head>

<p>
The myriad-minded man, our, and all men's
Shakespeare, has in this piece presented us
with a legitimate farce in exactest consonance with
the philosophical principles and character of farce,
as distinguished from comedy and from entertainments.
A proper farce is mainly distinguished
from comedy by the licence allowed, and even required,
in the fable, in order to produce strange
and laughable situations. The story need not be
probable, it is enough that it is possible. A
comedy would scarcely allow even the two Antipholuses;
because, although there have been instances
of almost indistinguishable likeness in two
persons, yet these are mere individual accidents,
<hi rend='italic'>casus ludentis naturæ</hi>,
and the <hi rend='italic'>verum</hi> will not excuse
the <hi rend='italic'>inverisimile</hi>. But farce dares add the two
Dromios, and is justified in so doing by the laws
of its end and constitution. In a word, farces
commence in a postulate, which must be granted.

</lg>

<p>
There is a beauty here. The word <q>boy</q>
naturally provokes and awakens in Orlando
the sense of his manly powers; and with the
retort of <q>elder brother,</q> he grasps him with
firm hands, and makes him feel he is no boy.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Ib.</hi>&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend='italic'>Oli.</hi> Farewell, good Charles. Now will I stir this gamester:
I hope, I shall see an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,
hates nothing more than him. Yet he's gentle; never school'd, and
yet learn'd; full of noble device; of all sorts enchantingly beloved!
and, indeed, so much in the heart of the world, and especially of my
own people, who best know him, that I am altogether misprised:
but it shall not be so long; this wrestler shall clear all.</q>
</p>

<p>
This has always appeared to me one of the most
un-Shakespearian speeches in all the genuine
works of our poet; yet I should be nothing surprised,
and greatly pleased, to find it hereafter a
fresh beauty, as has so often happened to me with
other supposed defects of great men.&mdash;1810.
</p>

<p>
It is too venturous to charge a passage in
Shakespeare with want of truth to nature; and
yet at first sight this speech of Oliver's expresses
truths, which it seems almost impossible that any
mind should so distinctly, so livelily, and so
voluntarily, have presented to itself, in connection
with feelings and intentions so malignant, and so
contrary to those which the qualities expressed
would naturally have called forth. But I dare
<pb n='108'/><anchor id='Pg108'/>
not say that this seeming unnaturalness is not in
the nature of an abused wilfulness, when united
with a strong intellect. In such characters there
is sometimes a gloomy self-gratification in making
the absoluteness of the will (<hi rend='italic'>sit pro ratione
voluntas!</hi>) evident to themselves by setting the
reason and the conscience in full array against it.&mdash;1818.

<emph>my child's father</emph>.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
Theobald restores this as the reading of the
older editions. It may be so: but who can doubt
that it is a mistake for <q>my father's child,</q> meaning
herself? According to Theobald's note, a
most indelicate anticipation is put into the mouth
of Rosalind without reason;&mdash;and besides, what a
strange thought, and how out of place and unintelligible!

Theobald's etymology of <q>cheveril</q> is, of course,

In the name of love and wonder, do not four kisses
make a double affirmative? The humour lies in
the whispered <q>No!</q> and the inviting <q>Don't!</q>
with which the maiden's kisses are accompanied,
and thence compared to negatives, which by repetition
constitute an affirmative.

As it stands, in spite of Warburton's note, I can
make little or nothing of it. Why should the king
except the then most illustrious states, which, as
being republics, were the more truly inheritors of
the Roman grandeur?&mdash;With my conjecture, the
sense would be;&mdash;<q>let higher, or the more northern
part of Italy&mdash;(unless <q>higher</q> be a corruption for
<q>hir'd,</q>&mdash;the metre seeming to demand a monosyllable)
(those bastards that inherit the infamy only

and <q>wed</q> are so far confirmative as they indicate
Shakespeare's manner of connection by unmarked
influences of association from some preceding metaphor.
<pb n='112'/><anchor id='Pg112'/>
This it is which makes his style so peculiarly
vital and organic. Likewise <q>those girls of
Italy</q> strengthen the guess. The absurdity of
Warburton's gloss, which represents the king calling
Italy superior, and then excepting the only
part the lords were going to visit, must strike

<head><q>Measure For Measure.</q></head>

<p>
This play, which is Shakespeare's throughout,
is to me the most painful&mdash;say rather, the only
painful&mdash;part of his genuine works. The comic
and tragic parts equally border on the μισητὸν,&mdash;the
one being disgusting, the other horrible; and
the pardon and marriage of Angelo not merely
baffles the strong indignant claim of justice&mdash;(for
cruelty, with lust and damnable baseness, cannot
be forgiven, because we cannot conceive them as
being morally repented of); but it is likewise degrading
to the character of woman. Beaumont
and Fletcher, who can follow Shakespeare in his
errors only, have presented a still worse, because
more loathsome and contradictory, instance of the
same kind in the <hi rend='italic'>Night-Walker</hi>, in the marriage
of Alathe to Algripe. Of the counter-balancing
beauties of <hi rend='italic'>Measure for Measure</hi>, I need say nothing;

<p>
I cannot but think this rather a heroic resolve,
than an infamous wish. It appears to me to be
the grandest symptom of an immortal spirit, when
<pb n='116'/><anchor id='Pg116'/>
even that bedimmed and overwhelmed spirit recked
not of its own immortality, still to seek to be,&mdash;to
be a mind, a will.

<p>
As fame is to reputation, so heaven is to an
estate, or immediate advantage. The difference
is, that the self-love of the former cannot exist
but by a complete suppression and habitual supplantation
of immediate selfishness. In one point
of view, the miser is more estimable than the
spendthrift;&mdash;only that the miser's present feelings
are as much of the present as the spendthrift's.
But <hi rend='italic'>cæteris paribus</hi>, that is, upon the
supposition that whatever is good or lovely in the
one coexists equally in the other, then, doubtless,
the master of the present is less a selfish being,
an animal, than he who lives for the moment with
no inheritance in the future. Whatever can degrade
man, is supposed in the latter case; whatever
can elevate him, in the former. And as to
self;&mdash;strange and generous self! that can only
be such a self by a complete divestment of all that
men call self,&mdash;of all that can make it either
practically to others, or consciously to the individual
himself, different from the human race in
its ideal. Such self is but a perpetual religion,
an inalienable acknowledgment of God, the sole
basis and ground of being. In this sense, how
can I love God, and not love myself, as far as it
is of God?

<p>
Act i. sc. 1.&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">You do not meet a man, but frowns: our bloods</q></l>
<l>No more obey the heavens, than our courtiers'</l>
<l><q rend="post">Still seem, as does the king's.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
There can be little doubt of Mr. Tyrwhitt's
emendations of <q>courtiers</q> and <q>king,</q> as
to the sense;&mdash;only it is not impossible that
Shakespeare's dramatic language may allow of the
word <q>brows</q> or <q>faces</q> being understood after
the word <q>courtiers',</q> which might then remain
in the genitive case plural. But the nominative
plural makes excellent sense, and is sufficiently
elegant, and sounds to my ear Shakespearian.
What, however, is meant by <q>our bloods no more
obey the heavens?</q>&mdash;Dr. Johnson's assertion
that <q>bloods</q> signify <q>countenances,</q> is, I think,
mistaken both in the thought conveyed&mdash;(for it
was never a popular belief that the stars governed
men's countenances)&mdash;and in the usage, which
requires an antithesis of the blood,&mdash;or the temperament
of the four humours, choler, melancholy,
phlegm, and the red globules, or the sanguine
portion, which was supposed not to be in our own
power, but to be dependent on the influences of
the heavenly bodies,&mdash;and the countenances which
are in our power really, though from flattery we
bring them into a no less apparent dependence on
<pb n='118'/><anchor id='Pg118'/>
the sovereign, than the former are in actual
dependence on the constellations.
</p>

<p>
I have sometimes thought that the word <q>courtiers</q>
was a misprint for <q>countenances,</q> arising
from an anticipation, by foreglance of the compositor's
eye, of the word <q>courtier</q> a few lines
below. The written <hi rend='italic'>r</hi> is easily and often confounded
with, the written <hi rend='italic'>n</hi>. The compositor read
the first syllable <hi rend='italic'>court</hi>, and&mdash;his eye at the same
time catching the word <q>courtier</q> lower down&mdash;he
completed the word without reconsulting the
copy. It is not unlikely that Shakespeare intended
first to express, generally, the same
thought, which a little afterwards he repeats with
a particular application to the persons meant;&mdash;a
common usage of the pronominal <q>our,</q> where
the speaker does not really mean to include himself;
and the word <q>you</q> is an additional confirmation
of the <q>our,</q> being used in this place for
<q>men</q> generally and indefinitely,&mdash;just as <q>you
do not meet</q> is the same as <q>one does not meet.</q>

</lg>

<p>
How is it that the commentators take no notice

<pb n='119'/><anchor id='Pg119'/>
in the harmony with the sense and feeling? Some

<q>youth,</q>&mdash;possibly <q>and see</q>:&mdash;

<p>
But <q><emph>this</emph> eye,</q> in spite of the supposition of its

of the word, which I think is not derived
from <hi rend='italic'>umbra</hi>, a shade,
but from <hi rend='italic'>umber</hi>, a dingy
yellow-brown soil, which most commonly forms
the mass of the sludge on the sea-shore, and on
the banks of tide-rivers at low water. One other
possible interpretation of this sentence has occurred
to me, just barely worth mentioning;&mdash;that
<pb n='120'/><anchor id='Pg120'/>

<p>
That Shakespeare never <q>turned his genius to

of about as much authority as the precious

that he lived by holding gentlemen's horses at the

old Aubrey. The metre is an argument

<quote rend="display">
<q>Mr. Pope (after Dryden) informs us that the story of <hi rend='italic'>Troilus
and Cressida</hi> was originally the work of one Lollius, a Lombard:
but Dryden goes yet further; he declares it to have been written in
Latin verse, and that Chaucer translated it. <emph>Lollius was a historiographer
of Urbino in Italy.</emph></q>&mdash;Note in Stockdale's edition, 1807.
</quote>

<p>
<q>Lollius was a historiographer of Urbino in
Italy.</q> So affirms the notary to whom the
Sieur Stockdale committed the <hi rend='italic'>disfaciménto</hi> of
Ayscough's excellent edition of Shakespeare.
Pity that the researchful notary has not either
told us in what century, and of what history, he
was a writer, or been simply content to depose,
that Lollius, if a writer of that name existed at
all, was a somewhat somewhere. The notary
speaks of the <hi rend='italic'>Troy Boke</hi> of Lydgate, printed in
1513. I have never seen it; but I deeply regret
that Chalmers did not substitute the whole of
Lydgate's works from the MSS. extant, for the
almost worthless Gower.
</p>

<p>
The <hi rend='italic'>Troilus and Cressida</hi> of Shakespeare can
scarcely be classed with his dramas of Greek and
Roman history; but it forms an intermediate link
between the fictitious Greek and Roman histories,
which we may call legendary dramas, and the
proper ancient histories,&mdash;that is, between the
<hi rend='italic'>Pericles</hi> or <hi rend='italic'>Titus Andronicus</hi>,
and the <hi rend='italic'>Coriolanus</hi>
or <hi rend='italic'>Julius Cæsar</hi>.
<hi rend='italic'>Cymbeline</hi> is a <hi rend='italic'>congener</hi> with
<hi rend='italic'>Pericles</hi>, and distinguished from
<hi rend='italic'>Lear</hi> by not
having any declared prominent object. But where
<pb n='124'/><anchor id='Pg124'/>
shall we class the <hi rend='italic'>Timon of Athens</hi>? Perhaps
immediately below <hi rend='italic'>Lear</hi>. It is a <hi rend='italic'>Lear</hi> of the
satirical drama; a <hi rend='italic'>Lear</hi> of domestic or ordinary
life;&mdash;a local eddy of passion on the high road of
society, while all around is the week-day goings
on of wind and weather; a <hi rend='italic'>Lear</hi>, therefore, without
its soul-searching flashes, its ear-cleaving
thunder-claps, its meteoric splendours,&mdash;without
the contagion and the fearful sympathies of
nature, the fates, the furies, the frenzied elements,
dancing in and out, now breaking through and
scattering,&mdash;now hand in hand with,&mdash;the fierce
or fantastic group of human passions, crimes, and
anguishes, reeling on the unsteady ground, in a
wild harmony to the shock and the swell of an
earthquake. But my present subject was <hi rend='italic'>Troilus
and Cressida</hi>; and I suppose that, scarcely knowing
what to say of it, I by a cunning of instinct
ran off to subjects on which I should find it difficult not
to say too much, though certain after all
that I should still leave the better part unsaid,
and the gleaning for others richer than my own
harvest.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, there is no one of Shakespeare's plays
harder to characterise. The name and the remembrances
connected with it, prepare us for the representation
of attachment no less faithful than
fervent on the side of the youth, and of sudden
and shameless inconstancy on the part of the lady.
And this is, indeed, as the gold thread on which
the scenes are strung, though often kept out of
sight and out of mind by gems of greater value
than itself. But as Shakespeare calls forth nothing
from the mausoleum of history, or the catacombs
of tradition, without giving, or eliciting, some
<pb n='125'/><anchor id='Pg125'/>
permanent and general interest, and brings forward
no subject which he does not moralise or
intellectualise,&mdash;so here he has drawn in Cressida
the portrait of a vehement passion, that, having
its true origin and proper cause in warmth of
temperament, fastens on, rather than fixes to,
some one object by liking and temporary preference.
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">There's language in her eye, her cheek, her lip,</q></l>
<l>Nay, her foot speaks; her wanton spirit looks out</l>
<l><q rend="post">At every joint and motive of her body.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
This Shakespeare has contrasted with the profound
affection represented in Troilus, and alone
worthy the name of love;&mdash;affection, passionate
indeed,&mdash;swoln with the confluence of youthful
instincts and youthful fancy, and growing in the
radiance of hope newly risen, in short, enlarged
by the collective sympathies of nature;&mdash;but still
having a depth of calmer element in a will stronger
than desire, more entire than choice, and which
gives permanence to its own act by converting it
into faith and duty. Hence, with excellent judgment,
and with an excellence higher than mere
judgment can give, at the close of the play, when
Cressida has sunk into infamy below retrieval and
beneath hope, the same will, which had been the
substance and the basis of his love, while the restless
pleasures and passionate longings, like sea-waves,
had tossed but on its surface,&mdash;this same
moral energy is represented as snatching him aloof
from all neighbourhood with her dishonour, from
all lingering fondness and languishing regrets,
whilst it rushes with him into other and nobler
duties, and deepens the channel, which his heroic
brother's death had left empty for its collected
<pb n='126'/><anchor id='Pg126'/>
flood. Yet another secondary and subordinate
purpose Shakespeare has inwoven with his delineation
of these two characters,&mdash;that of opposing
the inferior civilisation, but purer morals, of the
Trojans to the refinements, deep policy, but duplicity
and sensual corruptions of the Greeks.
</p>

<p>
To all this, however, so little comparative projection
is given,&mdash;nay, the masterly group of
Agamemnon, Nestor, and Ulysses, and, still more
in advance, that of Achilles, Ajax, and Thersites,
so manifestly occupying the fore-ground, that the
subservience and vassalage of strength and animal
courage to intellect and policy seems to be the
lesson most often in our poet's view, and which he
has taken little pains to connect with the former
more interesting moral impersonated in the titular
hero and heroine of the drama. But I am half
inclined to believe, that Shakespeare's main object,
or shall I rather say his ruling impulse, was to
translate the poetic heroes of paganism into the
not less rude, but more intellectually vigorous,
and more <emph>featurely</emph>, warriors of Christian chivalry,&mdash;and
to substantiate the distinct and graceful
profiles or outlines of the Homeric epic into the
flesh and blood of the romantic drama;&mdash;in short,
to give a grand history-piece in the robust style
of Albert Durer.
</p>

<p>
The character of Thersites, in particular, well
deserves a more careful examination, as the Caliban
of demagogic life;&mdash;the admirable portrait of intellectual
power deserted by all grace, all moral
principle, all not momentary impulse;&mdash;just wise
enough to detect the weak head, and fool enough
to provoke the armed fist of his betters;&mdash;one whom
malcontent Achilles can inveigle from malcontent
<pb n='127'/><anchor id='Pg127'/>
Ajax, under the one condition, that he shall be
called on to do nothing but abuse and slander, and
that he shall be allowed to abuse as much and as
purulently as he likes, that is, as he can;&mdash;in short,
a mule,&mdash;quarrelsome by the original discord of his
nature;&mdash;a slave by tenure of his own baseness,&mdash;made
to bray and be brayed at, to despise and be
despicable. <q>Aye, Sir, but say what you will, he
is a very clever fellow, though the best friends will
fall out. There was a time when Ajax thought he
deserved to have a statue of gold erected to him
and handsome Achilles, at the head of the Myrmidons,
gave no little credit to his <hi rend='italic'>friend Thersites</hi>!</q>

This play illustrates the wonderfully philosophic

the public good, the individual Brutus' honour, and
his death. The latter two so balanced each other,
that he could decide for the first by equipoise; nay&mdash;the
thought growing&mdash;that honour had more
weight than death. That Cassius understood it as
Warburton, is the beauty of Cassius as contrasted
with Brutus.

<p>
This speech is singular;&mdash;at least, I do not at
<pb n='133'/><anchor id='Pg133'/>
present see into Shakespeare's motive, his <emph>rationale</emph>,
or in what point of view he meant Brutus' character
to appear. For surely&mdash;(this, I mean, is what I say
to myself, with my present <hi rend='italic'>quantum</hi> of insight,
only modified by my experience in how many instances
I have ripened into a perception of beauties,
where I had before descried faults;) surely, nothing
can seem more discordant with our historical preconceptions
of Brutus, or more lowering to the
intellect of the Stoico-Platonic tyrannicide, than
the tenets here attributed to him&mdash;to him, the
stern Roman republican; namely,&mdash;that he would
have no objection to a king, or to Cæsar, a monarch
in Rome, would Cæsar but be as good a monarch
as he now seems disposed to be! How, too, could
Brutus say that he found no personal cause&mdash;none
in Cæsar's past conduct as a man? Had he not
passed the Rubicon? Had he not entered Rome as
a conqueror? Had he not placed his Gauls in the
Senate?&mdash;Shakespeare, it may be said, has not
brought these things forward&mdash;True;&mdash;and this is
just the ground of my perplexity. What character
did Shakespeare mean his Brutus to be?

Surely, there need be no scruple in treating this
<q>path</q> as a mere misprint or mis-script for <q>put.</q>

No doubt, it should be <hi rend='italic'>statua</hi>, as in the same age,
they more often pronounced <q>heroes</q> as a trisyllable

have written,&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q>Last night she dreamt that she my statue saw.</q></l>

<p>
But Shakespeare never avails himself of the supposed
license of transposition, merely for the metre.
There is always some logic either of thought or
passion to justify it.

</lg>

<p>
I doubt the genuineness of the last two lines;&mdash;not
because they are vile; but first, on account of
the rhythm, which is not Shakespearian, but just
the very tune of some old play, from which the
actor might have interpolated them;&mdash;and secondly,
because they interrupt, not only the sense and
connection, but likewise the flow both of the passion,
and (what is with me still more decisive) of
the Shakespearian link of association. As with
many another parenthesis or gloss slipt into the
text, we have only to read the passage without it,
to see that it never was in it. I venture to say
there is no instance in Shakespeare fairly like this.
Conceits he has; but they not only rise out of some
word in the lines before, but also lead to the thought
in the lines following. Here the conceit is a mere
alien: Antony forgets an image, when he is even
touching it, and then recollects it, when the thought
last in his mind must have led him away from it.

</lg>

<pb n='135'/><anchor id='Pg135'/>

<p>
This seemingly strange assertion of Brutus is
unhappily verified in the present day. What is
an immense army, in which the lust of plunder has
quenched all the duties of the citizen, other than a
horde of robbers, or differenced only as fiends are
from ordinarily reprobate men? Cæsar supported,
and was supported by, such as these;&mdash;and even so
Buonaparte in our days.
</p>

<p>
I know no part of Shakespeare that more impresses
on me the belief of his genius being superhuman,
than this scene between Brutus and Cassius.
In the Gnostic heresy it might have been credited
with less absurdity than most of their dogmas, that
the Supreme had employed him to create, previously
to his function of representing, characters.

<head><q>Antony And Cleopatra.</q></head>

<p>
Shakespeare can be complimented only by
comparison with himself: all other eulogies are
either heterogeneous, as when they are in reference
to Spenser or Milton; or they are flat truisms, as
when he is gravely preferred to Corneille, Racine,
or even his own immediate successors, Beaumont
and Fletcher, Massinger and the rest. The highest
praise, or rather form of praise, of this play, which
I can offer in my own mind, is the doubt which the
perusal always occasions in me, whether the <hi rend='italic'>Antony
and Cleopatra</hi> is not, in all exhibitions of a giant
power in its strength and vigour of maturity, a
formidable rival of <hi rend='italic'>Macbeth</hi>,
<hi rend='italic'>Lear</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>Hamlet</hi>, and
<hi rend='italic'>Othello</hi>. <hi rend='italic'>Feliciter audax</hi>
is the motto for its style
comparatively with that of Shakespeare's other
works, even as it is the general motto of all his
works compared with those of other poets. Be it
remembered, too, that this happy valiancy of style
is but the representative and result of all the
material excellencies so expressed.
</p>

<p>
This play should be perused in mental contrast
with <hi rend='italic'>Romeo and Juliet</hi>;&mdash;as the love of passion
and appetite opposed to the love of affection and
instinct. But the art displayed in the character of
Cleopatra is profound; in this, especially, that the
sense of criminality in her passion is lessened by
our insight into its depth and energy, at the very
moment that we cannot but perceive that the passion
<pb n='138'/><anchor id='Pg138'/>
itself springs out of the habitual craving of a
licentious nature, and that it is supported and
reinforced by voluntary stimulus and sought-for
associations, instead of blossoming out of spontaneous
emotion.
</p>

<p>
Of all Shakespeare's historical plays, <hi rend='italic'>Antony and
Cleopatra</hi> is by far the most wonderful. There is
not one in which he has followed history so
minutely, and yet there are few in which he impresses
the notion of angelic strength so much;&mdash;perhaps
none in which he impresses it more
strongly. This is greatly owing to the manner in
which the fiery force is sustained throughout, and
to the numerous momentary flashes of nature counteracting
the historic abstraction. As a wonderful
specimen of the way in which Shakespeare lives up
to the very end of this play, read the last part of
the concluding scene. And if you would feel the
judgment as well as the genius of Shakespeare in
your heart's core, compare this astonishing drama
with Dryden's <hi rend='italic'>All For Love</hi>.

</lg>

<p>
Warburton's conjecture of <q>stool</q> is ingenious,
and would be a probable reading, if the scene opening
had discovered Antony with Cleopatra on his
lap. But, represented as he is walking and jesting
with her, <q>fool</q> must be the word. Warburton's
<pb n='139'/><anchor id='Pg139'/>
objection is shallow, and implies that he confounded
the dramatic with the epic style. The <q>pillar</q>
of a state is so common a metaphor as to have lost
the image in the thing meant to be imaged.

<p>
This is so far true to appearance, that a horse-hair,

water,</q> will become the supporter of seemingly one
worm, though probably of an immense number of

a finger, and sensibly compress it. It is a common

Westmoreland.

his comments, ingenious in blunder; he can never
see any other writer's thoughts for the mist-working
swarm of his own. The meaning of the first line
the poet himself explains, or rather unfolds, in the
second. <q>The man is honest!</q>&mdash;<q>True;&mdash;and for
that very cause, and with no additional or extrinsic
motive, he will be so. No man can be justly called
honest, who is not so for honesty's sake, itself including
its own reward.</q> Note, that <q>honesty</q> in
Shakespeare's age retained much of its old dignity,
and that contradistinction of the <hi rend='italic'>honestum</hi> from the

I may remark here the fineness of Shakespeare's

with the same musical or, rather dissonant, notation.
Try the one, and then the other, by your

ground on which you now excuse yourself. Or,
perhaps, no correction is necessary, if we construe
<q>made you</q> as <q>did you make;</q> <q>and that unaptness

<p>
This latter clause I grievously suspect to have
been an addition of the players, which had hit, and,
being constantly applauded, procured a settled
occupation in the prompter's copy. Not that
Shakespeare does not elsewhere sneer at the Puritans;

I cannot see the necessity of this alteration. The

enough to cry out against Shakespeare's laxities

merely a poet, but a dramatic poet; that, when the
head and the heart are swelling with fulness, a
man does not ask himself whether he has grammatically
arranged, but only whether (the context
taken in) he has conveyed his meaning. <q>Deny</q>
is here clearly equal to <q>withhold;</q> and the <q>it,</q>
quite in the genius of vehement conversation, which
a syntaxist explains by ellipses and <hi rend='italic'>subauditurs</hi> in

ignorances in a contemporary, refers to accidental

<head><q>Romeo And Juliet.</q></head>

<p>
I have previously had occasion to speak at large
on the subject of the three unities of time, place,
and action, as applied to the drama in the abstract,
and to the particular stage for which Shakespeare
wrote, as far as he can be said to have written for
any stage but that of the universal mind. I hope
I have in some measure succeeded in demonstrating
that the former two, instead of being rules,
were mere inconveniences attached to the local
peculiarities of the Athenian drama; that the last
alone deserved the name of a principle, and that in
the preservation of this unity Shakespeare stood
pre-eminent. Yet, instead of unity of action, I
should greatly prefer the more appropriate, though
scholastic and uncouth, words homogeneity, proportionateness,
and totality of interest,&mdash;expressions,
which involve the distinction, or rather the
essential difference, betwixt the shaping skill of
mechanical talent, and the creative, productive,
life-power of inspired genius. In the former each
part is separately conceived, and then by a succeeding
act put together;&mdash;not as watches are
made for wholesale&mdash;(for there each part supposes
a pre-conception of the whole in some mind),&mdash;but
more like pictures on a motley screen. Whence
arises the harmony that strikes us in the wildest
natural landscapes,&mdash;in the relative shapes of rocks,
<pb n='146'/><anchor id='Pg146'/>
the harmony of colours in the heaths, ferns, and
lichens, the leaves of the beech and the oak, the
stems and rich brown branches of the birch and
other mountain trees, varying from verging autumn
to returning spring,&mdash;compared with the visual
effect from the greater number of artificial plantations?&mdash;From
this, that the natural landscape is
effected, as it were, by a single energy modified <hi rend='italic'>ab
intra</hi> in each component part. And as this is the
particular excellence of the Shakespearian drama
generally, so is it especially characteristic of the
<hi rend='italic'>Romeo and Juliet</hi>.
</p>

<p>
The groundwork of the tale is altogether in
family life, and the events of the play have their
first origin in family feuds. Filmy as are the eyes
of party-spirit, at once dim and truculent, still
there is commonly some real or supposed object in
view, or principle to be maintained; and though
but the twisted wires on the plate of rosin in the
preparation for electrical pictures, it is still a guide
in some degree, an assimilation to an outline. But
in family quarrels, which have proved scarcely less
injurious to states, wilfulness, and precipitancy, and
passion from mere habit and custom can alone be
expected. With his accustomed judgment, Shakespeare
has begun by placing before us a lively
picture of all the impulses of the play; and, as
nature ever presents two sides, one for Heraclitus,
and one for Democritus, he has, by way of prelude,
shown the laughable absurdity of the evil by the
contagion of it reaching the servants who have so
little to do with it, but who are under the necessity
of letting the superfluity of sensoreal power fly
off through the escape-valve of wit-combats, and of
quarrelling with weapons of sharper edge, all in
<pb n='147'/><anchor id='Pg147'/>
humble imitation of their masters. Yet there is
a sort of unhired fidelity, an <hi rend='italic'>ourishness</hi> about all
this that makes it rest pleasant on one's feelings.
All the first scene, down to the conclusion of the
Prince's speech, is a motley dance of all ranks and
ages to one tune, as if the horn of Huon had been
playing behind the scenes.

</lg>

<p>
prove that Shakespeare meant the <hi rend='italic'>Romeo and Juliet</hi>
to approach to a poem, which, and indeed its early
date, may be also inferred from the multitude of
rhyming couplets throughout. And if we are right,
from the internal evidence, in pronouncing this one
of Shakespeare's early dramas, it affords a strong
instance of the fineness of his insight into the nature
of the passions, that Romeo is introduced already
love-bewildered. The necessity of loving creates
an object for itself in man and woman; and yet
there is a difference in this respect between the
sexes, though only to be known by a perception of
it. It would have displeased us if Juliet had been
represented as already in love, or as fancying herself
so;&mdash;but no one, I believe, ever experiences
any shock at Romeo's forgetting his Rosaline, who
had been a mere name for the yearning of his
youthful imagination, and rushing into his passion
for Juliet. Rosaline was a mere creation of his
fancy; and we should remark the boastful positiveness
<pb n='148'/><anchor id='Pg148'/>
of Romeo in a love of his own making, which
is never shown where love is really near the heart.

The character of the Nurse is the nearest of any

a representative of a class,&mdash;just as in describing
one larch tree, you generalise a grove of them,&mdash;so
it is nearly as much so in old age. The generalisation
is done to the poet's hand. Here you have
the garrulity of age strengthened by the feelings of
a long-trusted servant, whose sympathy with the
mother's affections gives her privileges and rank
in the household; and observe the mode of connection
by accidents of time and place, and the
childlike fondness of repetition in a second childhood,
and also that happy humble, ducking under,
yet constant resurgence against, the check of her
superiors!&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q>Yes, madam!&mdash;Yet I cannot choose but laugh,</q> &amp;c.</l>
</lg>

<p>
In the fourth scene we have Mercutio introduced
to us. O! how shall I describe that exquisite
ebullience and overflow of youthful life, wafted on
over the laughing waves of pleasure and prosperity,
as a wanton beauty that distorts the face on which
she knows her lover is gazing enraptured, and
wrinkles her forehead in the triumph of its smoothness!
Wit ever wakeful, fancy busy and procreative
as an insect, courage, an easy mind that,
without cares of its own, is at once disposed to
<pb n='149'/><anchor id='Pg149'/>
laugh away those of others, and yet to be interested
in them,&mdash;these and all congenial qualities,
melting into the common <hi rend='italic'>copula</hi> of them all, the
man of rank and the gentleman, with all its excellencies
and all its weaknesses, constitute the character
of Mercutio!
</p>

<p>
Act i. sc. 5.&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre"><hi rend='italic'>Tyb.</hi> It fits when such a
villain is a guest;</q></l>
<l>I'll not endure him.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l><hi rend='italic'>Cap.</hi> He shall be endur'd.</l>
<l>What, goodman boy!&mdash;I say, he shall:&mdash;Go to;&mdash;</l>
<l>Am I the master here, or you?&mdash;Go to.</l>
<l>You'll not endure him!&mdash;God shall mend my soul&mdash;</l>
<l>You'll make a mutiny among my guests!</l>
<l>You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l><hi rend='italic'>Tyb.</hi> Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l><hi rend='italic'>Cap.</hi> Go to, go to,</l>
<l><q rend="post">You are a saucy boy!</q> &amp;c.</l>
</lg>

<p>
How admirable is the old man's impetuosity at
once contrasting, yet harmonised, with young
Tybalt's quarrelsome violence! But it would be
endless to repeat observations of this sort. Every
leaf is different on an oak tree; but still we can
only say&mdash;our tongues defrauding our eyes&mdash; <q>This
is another oak-leaf!</q>
</p>

<p>
Act ii. sc. 2. The garden scene.
</p>

<p>
Take notice in this enchanting scene of the contrast
of Romeo's love with his former fancy; and
weigh the skill shown in justifying him from his
inconstancy by making us feel the difference of his
passion. Yet this, too, is a love in, although not
merely of, the imagination.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Ib.</hi>&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre"><hi rend='italic'>Jul.</hi>
Well, do not swear; although I joy in thee,</q></l>
<l>I have no joy in this contract to-night:</l>
<l><q rend="post">It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden,</q> &amp;c.</l>
</lg>

<p>
With love, pure love, there is always an anxiety
for the safety of the object, a disinterestedness, by
<pb n='150'/><anchor id='Pg150'/>
which it is distinguished from the counterfeits of
its name. Compare this scene with Act iii. sc. 1
of the <hi rend='italic'>Tempest</hi>. I do not know a more wonderful
instance of Shakespeare's mastery in playing a
distinctly rememberable variety on the same remembered
air, than in the transporting love confessions
of Romeo and Juliet and Ferdinand and
Miranda. There seems more passion in the one,
and more dignity in the other; yet you feel that
the sweet girlish lingering and busy movement of
Juliet, and the calmer and more maidenly fondness
of Miranda, might easily pass into each other.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Ib.</hi> sc. 3. The Friar's speech.
</p>

<p>
The reverend character of the Friar, like all
Shakespeare's representations of the great professions,
is very delightful and tranquillising, yet it
is no digression, but immediately necessary to the
carrying on of the plot.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Ib.</hi> sc. 4.&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend="display">
<q><hi rend='italic'>Rom.</hi> Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give
you?</q> &amp;c.
</quote>

<p>
Compare again Romeo's half-exerted, and half
real, ease of mind with his first manner when in
love with Rosaline! His will had come to the
clenching point.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Ib.</hi> sc. 6.&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre"><hi rend='italic'>Rom.</hi> Do thou but
close our hands with holy words,</q></l>
<l>Then love-devouring death do what he dare,</l>
<l><q rend="post">It is enough I may but call her mine.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
The precipitancy, which is the character of the
play, is well marked in this short scene of waiting
for Juliet's arrival.
</p>

<p>
Act iii. sc. 1.&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend="display">
<q><hi rend='italic'>Mer.</hi> No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church
door; but 'tis enough: 'twill serve: ask for me to-morrow, and you

<pb n='151'/><anchor id='Pg151'/>

<p>
How fine an effect the wit and raillery habitual
to Mercutio, even struggling with his pain, give
to Romeo's following speech, and at the same time
so completely justifying his passionate revenge
on Tybalt!
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Ib.</hi> Benvolio's speech:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 10">... <q rend="pre">But that he tilts</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast.</q></l>

<l><q rend="post">Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
Indeed the whole of this speech is imagination
strained to the highest; and observe the blessed
effect on the purity of the mind. What would
Dryden have made of it?

</lg>

<p>
A noble scene! Don't I see it with my own
eyes?&mdash;Yes! but not with Juliet's. And observe
in Capulet's last speech in this scene his mistake,
<pb n='152'/><anchor id='Pg152'/>
as if love's causes were capable of being
generalised.
</p>

<p>
Act iv. sc. 3. Juliet's speech.:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost</q></l>
<l>Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body</l>
<l>Upon a rapier's point:&mdash;Stay, Tybalt, stay!&mdash;</l>
<l><q rend="post">Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
Shakespeare provides for the finest decencies.
It would have been too bold a thing for a girl of
fifteen;&mdash;but she swallows the draught in a fit of
fright.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Ib.</hi> sc. 5.&mdash;
</p>

<p>
As the audience know that Juliet is not dead,
this scene is, perhaps, excusable. But it is a
strong warning to minor dramatists not to introduce
at one time many separate characters agitated
by one and the same circumstance. It is difficult
to understand what effect, whether that of pity or
of laughter, Shakespeare meant to produce;&mdash;the
occasion and the characteristic speeches are so
little in harmony! For example, what the Nurse
says is excellently suited to the Nurse's character,
but grotesquely unsuited to the occasion.
</p>

<p>
Act v. sc. 1. Romeo's speech:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 10">... <q rend="pre">O mischief! thou art swift</q></l>
<l>To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!</l>
<l><q rend="post">I do remember an apothecary,</q> &amp;c.</l>
</lg>

<p>
This famous passage is so beautiful as to be self-justified;
yet, in addition, what a fine preparation
it is for the tomb scene!
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Ib.</hi> sc. 3. Romeo's speech:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man,</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">Fly hence and leave me.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
The gentleness of Romeo was shown before, as
softened by love; and now it is doubled by love
and sorrow and awe of the place where he is.
</p>

<pb n='153'/><anchor id='Pg153'/>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Ib.</hi> Romeo's speech:&mdash;--

</lg>

<p>
Here, here, is the master example how beauty
can at once increase and modify passion!
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Ib.</hi> Last scene.

How beautiful is the close! The spring and

<head>Shakespeare's English Historical Plays.</head>

<p>
The first form of poetry is the epic, the essence
of which may be stated as the successive in
events and characters. This must be distinguished
from narration, in which there must always be a
narrator, from whom the objects represented receive
a colouring and a manner;&mdash;whereas in the
epic, as in the so-called poems of Homer, the whole
is completely objective, and the representation is a
pure reflection. The next form into which poetry
passed was the dramatic;&mdash;both forms having a
common basis with a certain difference, and that
difference not consisting in the dialogue alone.
Both are founded on the relation of providence to
the human will; and this relation is the universal
element, expressed under different points of view
according to the difference of religion, and the
moral and intellectual cultivation of different
nations. In the epic poem fate is represented as
overruling the will, and making it instrumental
to the accomplishment of its designs:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l>... Διὸς τελείετο βονλή</l>
</lg>

<p>
In the drama, the will is exhibited as struggling
with fate, a great and beautiful instance and illustration
of which is the <hi rend='italic'>Prometheus</hi> of Æschylus;
and the deepest effect is produced when the fate
<pb n='156'/><anchor id='Pg156'/>
is represented as a higher and intelligent will, and
the opposition of the individual as springing from
a defect.
</p>

<p>
In order that a drama may be properly historical,
it is necessary that it should be the history
of the people to whom it is addressed. In the
composition, care must be taken that there appear
no dramatic improbability, as the reality is taken
for granted. It must, likewise, be poetical;&mdash;that
only, I mean, must be taken which is the permanent
in our nature, which is common, and
therefore deeply interesting to all ages. The
events themselves are immaterial, otherwise than
as the clothing and manifestation of the spirit
that is working within. In this mode, the unity
resulting from succession is destroyed, but is supplied
by a unity of a higher order, which connects
the events by reference to the workers, gives a
reason for them in the motives, and presents men
in their causative character. It takes, therefore,
that part of real history which is the least known,
and infuses a principle of life and organisation
into the naked facts, and makes them all the
framework of an animated whole.
</p>

<p>
In my happier days, while I had yet hope and
onward-looking thoughts, I planned an historical
drama of King Stephen, in the manner of Shakespeare.
Indeed, it would be desirable that some
man of dramatic genius should dramatise all those
omitted by Shakespeare, as far down as Henry
VII. Perkin Warbeck would make a most interesting
drama. A few scenes of Marlow's
<hi rend='italic'>Edward II.</hi> might be preserved. After Henry
VIII., the events are too well and distinctly
known, to be, without plump inverisimilitude,
<pb n='157'/><anchor id='Pg157'/>
crowded together in one night's exhibition.
Whereas, the history of our ancient kings&mdash;the
events of the reigns, I mean&mdash;are like stars in the
sky;&mdash;whatever the real interspaces may be, and
however great, they seem close to each other.
The stars&mdash;the events&mdash;strike us and remain in
our eye, little modified by the difference of dates.
An historic drama is, therefore, a collection of
events borrowed from history, but connected together
in respect of cause and time, poetically and
by dramatic fiction. It would be a fine national
custom to act such a series of dramatic histories in
orderly succession, in the yearly Christmas holidays,
and could not but tend to counteract that
mock cosmopolitism, which under a positive term
really implies nothing but a negation of, or indifference
to, the particular love of our country.
By its nationality must every nation retain its
independence;&mdash;I mean a nationality <hi rend='italic'>quoad</hi> the
nation. Better thus;&mdash;nationality in each individual,
<hi rend='italic'>quoad</hi> his country, is equal to the sense of
individuality <hi rend='italic'>quoad</hi> himself; but himself as sub-sensuous
and central. Patriotism is equal to the
sense of individuality reflected from every other
individual. There may come a higher virtue in
both&mdash;just cosmopolitism. But this latter is not
possible but by antecedence of the former.
</p>

<p>
Shakespeare has included the most important
part of nine reigns in his historical dramas;&mdash;namely&mdash;King
John, Richard II.&mdash;Henry IV.
(two)&mdash;Henry V.&mdash;Henry VI. (three) including
Edward V. and Henry VIII., in all ten plays.
There remain, therefore, to be done, with the exception
of a single scene or two that should be
adopted from Marlow&mdash;eleven reigns&mdash;of which
<pb n='158'/><anchor id='Pg158'/>
the first two appear the only unpromising subjects;&mdash;and
those two dramas must be formed wholly or
mainly of invented private stories, which, however,
could not have happened except in consequence
of the events and measures of these reigns,
and which should furnish opportunity both of exhibiting
the manners and oppressions of the times,
and of narrating dramatically the great events;&mdash;if
possible, the death of the two sovereigns, at
least of the latter, should be made to have some
influence on the finale of the story. All the rest
are glorious subjects; especially Henry I. (being
the struggle between the men of arms and of
letters, in the persons of Henry and Becket),
Stephen, Richard I., Edward II., and Henry VII.

<p>
I have stated that the transitional link between
the epic poem and the drama is the
historic drama; that in the epic poem a pre-announced
fate gradually adjusts and employs the
will and the events as its instruments, whilst the
drama, on the other hand, places fate and will in
opposition to each other, and is then most perfect,
when the victory of fate is obtained in consequence
of imperfections in the opposing will, so as
to leave a final impression that the fate itself is
but a higher and a more intelligent will.
</p>

<p>
From the length of the speeches, and the circumstance
that, with one exception, the events are
all historical, and presented in their results, not
produced by acts seen by, or taking place before,
the audience, this tragedy is ill suited to our present
large theatres. But in itself, and for the
closet, I feel no hesitation in placing it as the first
and most admirable of all Shakespeare's purely
historical plays. For the two parts of <hi rend='italic'>Henry IV.</hi>
form a species of themselves, which may be named
the mixed drama. The distinction does not depend
on the mere quantity of historical events in the
play compared with the fictions; for there is as
much history in <hi rend='italic'>Macbeth</hi> as
in <hi rend='italic'>Richard</hi>, but in the
relation of the history to the plot. In the purely
historical plays, the history forms the plot; in the
mixed, it directs it; in the rest, as <hi rend='italic'>Macbeth</hi>,
<hi rend='italic'>Hamlet</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>Cymbeline</hi>,
<hi rend='italic'>Lear</hi>, it subserves it. But,
<pb n='162'/><anchor id='Pg162'/>
however unsuited to the stage this drama may be,
God forbid that even there it should fall dead on
the hearts of jacobinised Englishmen! Then,
indeed, we might say&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>præteriit gloria mundi!</hi>
For the spirit of patriotic reminiscence is the all-permeating
soul of this noble work. It is, perhaps,
the most purely historical of Shakespeare's dramas.
There are not in it, as in the others, characters
introduced merely for the purpose of giving a
greater individuality and realness, as in the comic
parts of <hi rend='italic'>Henry IV.</hi>, by presenting as it were our
very selves. Shakespeare avails himself of every
opportunity to effect the great object of the historic
drama,&mdash;that, namely, of familiarising the
people to the great names of their country, and
thereby of exciting a steady patriotism, a love of
just liberty, and a respect for all those fundamental
institutions of social life, which bind men
together:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">This royal throne of kings, this sceptred isle,</q></l>
<l>This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,</l>
<l>This other Eden, demi-paradise;</l>
<l>This fortress, built by nature for herself,</l>
<l>Against infection, and the hand of war;</l>
<l>This happy breed of men, this little world;</l>
<l>This precious stone set in the silver sea,</l>
<l>Which serves it in the office of a wall,</l>
<l>Or as a moat defensive to a home,</l>
<l>Against the envy of less happier lands;</l>
<l>This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,</l>
<l>This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Fear'd by their breed, and famous by their birth,</q> &amp;c.</l>
</lg>

<p>
Add the famous passage in <hi rend='italic'>King John</hi>:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">This England never did nor ever shall,</q></l>
<l>Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror,</l>
<l>But when it first did help to wound itself.</l>
<l>Now these her princes are come home again,</l>
<l>Come the three corners of the world in arms,</l>
<l>And we shall shock them: nought shall make us rue,</l>
<l><q rend="post">If England to itself do rest but true.</q></l>
</lg>

<pb n='163'/><anchor id='Pg163'/>

<p>
And it certainly seems that Shakespeare's historic
dramas produced a very deep effect on the minds
of the English people, and in earlier times they
were familiar even to the least informed of all
ranks, according to the relation of Bishop Corbett.
Marlborough, we know, was not ashamed to confess
that his principal acquaintance with English
history was derived from them; and I believe that
a large part of the information as to our old names
and achievements even now abroad is due, directly
or indirectly, to Shakespeare.
</p>

<p>
Admirable is the judgment with which Shakespeare
always in the first scenes prepares, yet how
naturally, and with what concealment of art, for
the catastrophe. Observe how he here presents
the germ of all the after events in Richard's insincerity,
partiality, arbitrariness, and favouritism,
and in the proud, tempestuous, temperament of
his barons. In the very beginning, also, is displayed
that feature in Richard's character, which
is never forgotten throughout the play&mdash;his attention
to decorum, and high feeling of the kingly
dignity. These anticipations show with what
judgment Shakespeare wrote, and illustrate his
care to connect the past and the future, and
unify them with the present by forecast and
reminiscence.
</p>

<p>
It is interesting to a critical ear to compare the
six opening lines of the play&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">Old John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster,</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,</q> &amp;c.</l>
</lg>

<p>
each closing at the tenth syllable, with the
rhythmless metre of the verse in <hi rend='italic'>Henry VI.</hi> and
<hi rend='italic'>Titus Andronicus</hi>, in order that the difference,
<pb n='164'/><anchor id='Pg164'/>
indeed, the heterogeneity, of the two may be felt
<hi rend='italic'>etiam in simillimis prima superficie</hi>. Here the
weight of the single words supplies all the relief
afforded by intercurrent verse, while the whole
represents the mood. And compare the apparently
defective metre of Bolingbroke's first line&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q>Many years of happy days befal</q>&mdash;</l>

verses.

I remember in the Sophoclean drama no more
striking example of the τὸ πρέπον καὶ σεμνὸν than
this speech; and the rhymes in the last six lines
well express the preconcertedness of Bolingbroke's
scheme so beautifully contrasted with the vehemence
and sincere irritation of Mowbray.

<p>
The occasional interspersion of rhymes, and the
more frequent winding up of a speech therewith&mdash;what
purpose was this designed to answer? In the
earnest drama, I mean. Deliberateness? An attempt,
as in Mowbray, to collect himself and be
cool at the close?&mdash;I can see that in the following
speeches the rhyme answers the end of the Greek
chorus, and distinguishes the general truths from
the passions of the dialogue; but this does not
exactly justify the practice, which is unfrequent in
proportion to the excellence of Shakespeare's plays.
One thing, however, is to be observed,&mdash;that the
speakers are historical, known, and so far formal
characters, and their reality is already a fact. This
should be borne in mind. The whole of this scene
of the quarrel between Mowbray and Bolingbroke
seems introduced for the purpose of showing by
anticipation the characters of Richard and Bolingbroke.
In the latter there is observable a decorous
and courtly checking of his anger in subservience
to a predetermined plan, especially in his calm
speech after receiving sentence of banishment compared
with Mowbray's unaffected lamentation. In
the one, all is ambitious hope of something yet to
come; in the other it is desolation and a looking
backward of the heart,

<p>
Without the hollow extravagance of Beaumont
and Fletcher's ultra-royalism, how carefully does
Shakespeare acknowledge and reverence the eternal
distinction between the mere individual, and the
<pb n='166'/><anchor id='Pg166'/>
symbolic or representative, on which all genial law,
no less than patriotism, depends. The whole of
this second scene commences, and is anticipative
of, the tone and character of the play at large.

dramas, or in those founded on a history as unknown
to his auditors generally as fiction, is this

proof, I think, that the pure historic drama, like
<hi rend='italic'>Richard II.</hi> and

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Ib.</hi> sc. 4. This is a striking conclusion of a first
act,&mdash;letting the reader into the secret;&mdash;having
before impressed us with the dignified and kingly
manners of Richard, yet by well managed anticipations
leading us on to the full gratification of
<pb n='167'/><anchor id='Pg167'/>
pleasure in our own penetration. In this scene a
new light is thrown on Richard's character. Until
now he has appeared in all the beauty of royalty;
but here, as soon as he is left to himself, the inherent
weakness of his character is immediately
shown. It is a weakness, however, of a peculiar
kind, not arising from want of personal courage,
or any specific defect of faculty, but rather an intellectual
feminineness, which feels a necessity of
ever leaning on the breasts of others, and of reclining
on those who are all the while known to be
inferiors. To this must be attributed as its consequences
all Richard's vices, his tendency to
concealment, and his cunning, the whole operation
of which is directed to the getting rid of present
difficulties. Richard is not meant to be a debauchee;
but we see in him that sophistry which is common
to man, by which we can deceive our own hearts,
and at one and the same time apologize for, and
yet commit, the error. Shakespeare has represented
this character in a very peculiar manner.
He has not made him amiable with counterbalancing
faults; but has openly and broadly drawn those
faults without reserve, relying on Richard's disproportionate
sufferings and gradually emergent
good qualities for our sympathy; and this was
possible, because his faults are not positive vices,
but spring entirely from defect of character.
</p>

Act ii. sc. 1.&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q><hi rend='italic'>K. Rich.</hi> Can sick men play so nicely
with their names?</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
Yes! on a death-bed there is a feeling which
may make all things appear but as puns and equivocations.
And a passion there is that carries off
its own excess by plays on words as naturally, and,
<pb n='168'/><anchor id='Pg168'/>
therefore, as appropriately to drama, as by gesticulations,
looks, or tones. This belongs to human
nature as such, independently of associations and
habits from any particular rank of life or mode of
employment; and in this consists Shakespeare's
vulgarisms, as in Macbeth's&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q>The devil damn thee black, thou cream-fac'd loon!</q> &amp;c.</l>
</lg>

<p>
This is (to equivocate on Dante's words) in truth
the <hi rend='italic'>nobile volgare eloquenza</hi>. Indeed it is profoundly
true that there is a natural, an almost irresistible,
tendency in the mind, when immersed in one
strong feeling, to connect that feeling with every
sight and object around it; especially if there be
opposition, and the words addressed to it are in any
way repugnant to the feeling itself, as here in the
instance of Richard's unkind language:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q>Misery makes sport to mock itself.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
No doubt, something of Shakespeare's punning
must be attributed to his age, in which direct and
formal combats of wit were a favourite pastime of
the courtly and accomplished. It was an age more
favourable, upon the whole, to vigour of intellect
than the present, in which a dread of being thought
pedantic dispirits and flattens the energies of original
minds. But independently of this, I have no
hesitation in saying that a pun, if it be congruous
with the feeling of the scene, is not only allowable
in the dramatic dialogue, but oftentimes one of the
most effectual intensives of passion.

</lg>

<pb n='169'/><anchor id='Pg169'/>

<p>
There is scarcely anything in Shakespeare in its
degree, more admirably drawn than York's character;
his religious loyalty struggling with a deep
grief and indignation at the king's follies; his adherence
to his word and faith, once given in spite
of all, even the most natural, feelings. You see in
him the weakness of old age, and the overwhelmingness
of circumstances, for a time surmounting
his sense of duty,&mdash;the junction of both exhibited
in his boldness in words and feebleness in immediate
act; and then again his effort to retrieve himself
in abstract loyalty, even at the heavy price of
the loss of his son. This species of accidental and
adventitious weakness is brought into parallel with
Richard's continually increasing energy of thought,
and as constantly diminishing power of acting;&mdash;and
thus it is Richard that breathes a harmony and
a relation into all the characters of the play.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre"><hi rend='italic'>Queen.</hi> To please the king

<l>I cannot do it; yet I know no cause</l>
<l>Why I should welcome such a guest as grief,</l>
<l>Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest</l>
<l>As my sweet Richard: yet again, methinks,</l>
<l>Some unborn sorrow, ripe in sorrow's womb,</l>
<l>Is coming toward me; and my inward soul</l>
<l>With nothing trembles: at something it grieves,</l>
<l><q rend="post">More than with parting from my lord the king.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
It is clear that Shakespeare never meant to represent
Richard as a vulgar debauchee, but a man
with a wantonness of spirit in external show, a
feminine <hi rend='italic'>friendism</hi>, an intensity of woman-like love
of those immediately about him, and a mistaking of
the delight of being loved by him for a love of him.
And mark in this scene Shakespeare's gentleness in
touching the tender superstitions, the <hi rend='italic'>terræ incognitæ</hi>
of presentiments, in the human mind; and
<pb n='170'/><anchor id='Pg170'/>
how sharp a line of distinction he commonly draws
between these obscure forecastings of general experience
in each individual, and the vulgar errors of
mere tradition. Indeed, it may be taken once for
all as the truth, that Shakespeare, in the absolute
universality of his genius, always reverences whatever
arises out of our moral nature; he never profanes
his muse with a contemptuous reasoning away
of the genuine and general, however unaccountable,
feelings of mankind.
</p>

<p>
The amiable part of Richard's character is
brought full upon us by his queen's few words&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 6">... <q rend="pre">So sweet a guest</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">As my sweet Richard:</q>&mdash;</l>
</lg>

<p>
and Shakespeare has carefully shown in him an
intense love of his country, well-knowing how that
feeling would, in a pure historic drama, redeem him
in the hearts of the audience. Yet even in this
love there is something feminine and personal:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,&mdash;</q></l>
<l>As a long parted mother with her child</l>
<l>Plays fondly with her tears, and smiles in meeting;</l>
<l>So weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And do thee favour with my royal hands.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
With this is combined a constant overflow of emotions
from a total incapability of controlling them,
and thence a waste of that energy, which should
have been reserved for actions, in the passion and
effort of mere resolves and menaces. The consequence
is moral exhaustion, and rapid alternations
of unmanly despair and ungrounded hope,&mdash;every
feeling being abandoned for its direct opposite upon
the pressure of external accident. And yet when
Richard's inward weakness appears to seek refuge
in his despair, and his exhaustion counterfeits repose,
the old habit of kingliness, the effect of
<pb n='171'/><anchor id='Pg171'/>
flatterers from his infancy, is ever and anon producing
in him a sort of wordy courage which only
serves to betray more clearly his internal impotence.
The second and third scenes of the third
act combine and illustrate all this:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre"><hi rend='italic'>Aumerle.</hi> He means,

<l>But when, from under this terrestrial ball,</l>
<l>He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines,</l>
<l>And darts his light through every guilty hole,</l>
<l>Then murders, treasons, and detested sins,</l>
<l>The cloke of night being pluckt from off their backs,</l>
<l>Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?</l>

Observe the fine struggle of a haughty sense of
power and ambition in Bolingbroke with the necessity
for dissimulation.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Ib.</hi> sc. 4. See here the skill and judgment of
our poet in giving reality and individual life, by the
introduction of accidents in his historic plays, and
thereby making them dramas, and not histories.
How beautiful an islet of repose&mdash;a melancholy
repose, indeed&mdash;is this scene with the Gardener and
his Servant. And how truly affecting and realising
is the incident of the very horse Barbary, in the
scene with the Groom in the last act!&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre"><hi rend='italic'>Groom.</hi> I was a poor groom of

<l>O, how it yearn'd my heart, when I beheld,</l>
<l>In London streets, that coronation day,</l>
<l>When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary!</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l><q rend="post"><hi rend='italic'>K. Rich.</hi> Rode he on Barbary?</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
Bolingbroke's character, in general, is an instance
how Shakespeare makes one play introductory to
another; for it is evidently a preparation for Henry
IV., as Gloster in the third part of <hi rend='italic'>Henry VI.</hi> is
for Richard III.
</p>

<p>
I would once more remark upon the exalted idea
of the only true loyalty developed in this noble and
impressive play. We have neither the rants of
Beaumont and Fletcher, nor the sneers of Massinger;&mdash;the
vast importance of the personal character
of the sovereign is distinctly enounced, whilst, at
the same time, the genuine sanctity which surrounds
him is attributed to, and grounded on, the position
in which he stands as the convergence and exponent
of the life and power of the state.
</p>

<pb n='173'/><anchor id='Pg173'/>

<p>
The great end of the body politic appears to be
to humanise, and assist in the progressiveness of,
the animal man;&mdash;but the problem is so complicated
with contingencies as to render it nearly impossible
to lay down rules for the formation of a state. And
should we be able to form a system of government,
which should so balance its different powers as to
form a check upon each, and so continually remedy
and correct itself, it would, nevertheless, defeat its
own aim;&mdash;for man is destined to be guided by
higher principles, by universal views, which can
never be fulfilled in this state of existence,&mdash;by a
spirit of progressiveness which can never be accomplished,
for then it would cease to be. Plato's
Republic is like Bunyan's Town of Man-Soul,&mdash;a
description of an individual, all of whose faculties
are in their proper subordination and inter-dependence;
and this it is assumed may be the prototype
of the state as one great individual. But there is
this sophism in it, that it is forgotten that the
human faculties, indeed, are parts and not separate
things; but that you could never get chiefs who
were wholly reason, ministers who were wholly
understanding, soldiers all wrath, labourers all concupiscence,
and so on through the rest. Each of
these partakes of, and interferes with, all the
others.

once been guilty of sneering at their great master,
cannot, I fear, be denied; but the passage quoted
by Theobald from the <hi rend='italic'>Knight of the Burning Pestle</hi>
is an imitation. If it be chargeable with any fault,
it is with plagiarism, not with sarcasm.

<p>
Does <q>grace</q> mean the king's own peculiar

his feudal rights in the military service of his
nobles?&mdash;I have sometimes thought it possible
that the words <q>grace</q> and <q>cause</q> may have been

<lg>
<l><q>They know your cause hath grace,</q> &amp;c.</l>

<head><q>Richard III.</q></head>

<p>
This play should be contrasted with <hi rend='italic'>Richard
II.</hi> Pride of intellect is the characteristic of
Richard, carried to the extent of even boasting to
his own mind of his villany, whilst others are present
to feed his pride of superiority; as in his first
speech, act ii. sc. 1. Shakespeare here, as in all
his great parts, developes in a tone of sublime
morality the dreadful consequences of placing the
moral, in subordination to the mere intellectual,
being. In Richard there is a predominance of
irony, accompanied with apparently blunt manners
to those immediately about him, but formalised
into a more set hypocrisy towards the people as
represented by their magistrates.

<head><q>Lear.</q></head>

<p>
Of all Shakespeare's plays <hi rend='italic'>Macbeth</hi> is the most
rapid, <hi rend='italic'>Hamlet</hi> the slowest, in
movement. <hi rend='italic'>Lear</hi>
combines length with rapidity,&mdash;like the hurricane
and the whirlpool, absorbing while it advances. It
begins as a stormy day in summer, with brightness;
but that brightness is lurid, and anticipates
the tempest.
</p>

<p>
It was not without forethought, nor is it without
its due significance, that the division of Lear's
kingdom is in the first six lines of the play stated
as a thing already determined in all its particulars,
previously to the trial of professions, as the relative
rewards of which the daughters were to be made to
consider their several portions. The strange, yet
by no means unnatural, mixture of selfishness,
sensibility, and habit of feeling derived from, and
fostered by, the particular rank and usages of the
individual;&mdash;the intense desire of being intensely
beloved,&mdash;selfish, and yet characteristic of the selfishness
of a loving and kindly nature alone;&mdash;the
self-supportless leaning for all pleasure on another's
breast;&mdash;the craving after sympathy with a prodigal
disinterestedness, frustrated by its own ostentation,
and the mode and nature of its claims;&mdash;the
anxiety, the distrust, the jealousy, which more
or less accompany all selfish affections, and are
amongst the surest contradistinctions of mere fondness
from true love, and which originate Lear's
eager wish to enjoy his daughter's violent professions,
<pb n='186'/><anchor id='Pg186'/>
whilst the inveterate habits of sovereignty
convert the wish into claim and positive right, and
an incompliance with it into crime and treason;&mdash;these
facts, these passions, these moral verities, on
which the whole tragedy is founded, are all prepared
for, and will to the retrospect be found
implied, in these first four or five lines of the play.
They let us know that the trial is but a trick; and
that the grossness of the old king's rage is in part
the natural result of a silly trick suddenly and
most unexpectedly baffled and disappointed.
</p>

<p>
It may here be worthy of notice, that <hi rend='italic'>Lear</hi> is
the only serious performance of Shakespeare, the
interest and situations of which are derived from
the assumption of a gross improbability; whereas
Beaumont and Fletcher's tragedies are, almost all
of them, founded on some out of the way accident
or exception to the general experience of mankind.
But observe the matchless judgment of our Shakespeare.
First, improbable as the conduct of Lear
is in the first scene, yet it was an old story rooted
in the popular faith,&mdash;a thing taken for granted
already, and consequently without any of the effects
of improbability. Secondly, it is merely the canvass
for the characters and passions,&mdash;a mere occasion
for,&mdash;and not, in the manner of Beaumont and
Fletcher, perpetually recurring as the cause, and
<hi rend='italic'>sine qua non</hi> of,&mdash;the incidents and emotions. Let
the first scene of this play have been lost, and let
it only be understood that a fond father had been
duped by hypocritical professions of love and duty
on the part of two daughters to disinherit the third,
previously, and deservedly, more dear to him;&mdash;and
all the rest of the tragedy would retain its
interest undiminished, and be perfectly intelligible.
</p>

<pb n='187'/><anchor id='Pg187'/>

<p>
The accidental is nowhere the groundwork of the
passions, but that which is catholic, which in all
ages has been, and ever will be, close and native to
the heart of man,&mdash;parental anguish from filial
ingratitude, the genuineness of worth, though
coffined in bluntness, and the execrable vileness of
a smooth iniquity. Perhaps I ought to have added
the <hi rend='italic'>Merchant of Venice</hi>; but here too the same
remarks apply. It was an old tale; and substitute
any other danger than that of the pound of flesh
(the circumstance in which the improbability lies),
yet all the situations and the emotions appertaining
to them remain equally excellent and appropriate.
Whereas take away from the <hi rend='italic'>Mad Lover</hi> of Beaumont
and Fletcher the fantastic hypothesis of his
engagement to cut out his own heart, and have it
presented to his mistress, and all the main scenes
must go with it.
</p>

<p>
Kotzebue is the German Beaumont and Fletcher,
without their poetic powers, and without their <hi rend='italic'>vis
comica</hi>. But, like them, he always deduces his
situations and passions from marvellous accidents,
and the trick of bringing one part of our moral
nature to counteract another; as our pity for misfortune
and admiration of generosity and courage
to combat our condemnation of guilt as in adultery,
robbery, and other heinous crimes;&mdash;and, like
them too, he excels in his mode of telling a story
clearly and interestingly, in a series of dramatic
dialogues. Only the trick of making tragedy-heroes
and heroines out of shopkeepers and barmaids was
too low for the age, and too unpoetic for the genius,
of Beaumont and Fletcher, inferior in every respect
as they are to their great predecessor and contemporary.
How inferior would they have appeared,
<pb n='188'/><anchor id='Pg188'/>
had not Shakespeare existed for them to imitate;&mdash;which
in every play, more or less, they do, and in
their tragedies most glaringly:&mdash;and yet&mdash;(O
shame! shame!)&mdash;they miss no opportunity of
sneering at the divine man, and sub-detracting
from his merits!
</p>

<p>
To return to <hi rend='italic'>Lear</hi>. Having thus in the fewest
words, and in a natural reply to as natural a question,&mdash;which
yet answers the secondary purpose of
attracting our attention to the difference or diversity
between the characters of Cornwall and Albany,&mdash;provided
the <hi rend='italic'>prémisses</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>data</hi>, as it were, for our
after insight into the mind and mood of the person,
whose character, passions, and sufferings are the
main subject-matter of the play;&mdash;from Lear, the
<hi rend='italic'>persona patiens</hi> of his drama, Shakespeare passes
without delay to the second in importance, the chief
agent and prime mover, and introduces Edmund to
our acquaintance, preparing us with the same felicity
of judgment, and in the same easy and natural
way, for his character in the seemingly casual communication
of its origin and occasion. From the
first drawing up of the curtain Edmund has stood
before us in the united strength and beauty of
earliest manhood. Our eyes have been questioning
him. Gifted as he is with high advantages of person,
and further endowed by nature with a powerful
intellect and a strong energetic will, even
without any concurrence of circumstances and
accident, pride will necessarily be the sin that most
easily besets him. But Edmund is also the known
and acknowledged son of the princely Gloster: he,
therefore, has both the germ of pride, and the conditions
best fitted to evolve and ripen it into a
predominant feeling. Yet hitherto no reason appears
<pb n='189'/><anchor id='Pg189'/>
why it should be other than the not unusual
pride of person, talent, and birth,&mdash;a pride auxiliary,
if not akin, to many virtues, and the natural
ally of honourable impulses. But alas! in his own
presence his own father takes shame to himself for
the frank avowal that he is his father,&mdash;he has
<q>blushed so often to acknowledge him that he is
now brazed to it!</q> Edmund hears the circumstances
of his birth spoken of with a most degrading
and licentious levity,&mdash;his mother described as a
wanton by her own paramour, and the remembrance
of the animal sting, the low criminal
gratifications connected with her wantonness and
prostituted beauty, assigned as the reason why
<q>the whoreson must be acknowledged!</q> This,
and the consciousness of its notoriety; the gnawing
conviction that every show of respect is an effort of
courtesy, which recalls, while it represses, a contrary
feeling;&mdash;this is the ever trickling flow of
wormwood and gall into the wounds of pride,&mdash;the
corrosive <hi rend='italic'>virus</hi> which inoculates pride with a
venom not its own, with envy, hatred, and a lust
for that power which in its blaze of radiance would
hide the dark spots on his disc,&mdash;with pangs of
shame personally undeserved, and therefore felt as
wrongs, and with a blind ferment of vindictive
working towards the occasions and causes, especially
towards a brother, whose stainless birth and
lawful honours were the constant remembrancers
of his own debasement, and were ever in the way
to prevent all chance of its being unknown, or
overlooked and forgotten. Add to this, that with
excellent judgment, and provident for the claims of
the moral sense,&mdash;for that which, relatively to the
drama, is called poetic justice, and as the fittest
<pb n='190'/><anchor id='Pg190'/>
means for reconciling the feelings of the spectators
to the horrors of Gloster's after sufferings,&mdash;at
least, of rendering them somewhat less unendurable&mdash;(for
I will not disguise my conviction, that
in this one point the tragic in this play has been
urged beyond the outermost mark and <hi rend='italic'>ne plus ultra</hi>
of the dramatic);&mdash;Shakespeare has precluded all
excuse and palliation of the guilt incurred by both
the parents of the base-born Edmund, by Gloster's
confession that he was at the time a married man,
and already blest with a lawful heir of his fortunes.
The mournful alienation of brotherly love, occasioned
by the law of primogeniture in noble families,
or rather by the unnecessary distinctions engrafted
thereon, and this in children of the same stock, is
still almost proverbial on the continent,&mdash;especially,
as I know from my own observation, in the south
of Europe,&mdash;and appears to have been scarcely less
common in our own island before the Revolution
of 1688, if we may judge from the characters and
sentiments so frequent in our elder comedies.
There is the younger brother, for instance, in
Beaumont and Fletcher's play of the <hi rend='italic'>Scornful
Lady</hi>, on the one side, and Oliver in Shakespeare's
<hi rend='italic'>As You Like It</hi>, on the other. Need it be said how
heavy an aggravation, in such a case, the stain
of bastardy must have been, were it only that the
younger brother was liable to hear his own dishonour
and his mother's infamy related by his
father with an excusing shrug of the shoulders,
and in a tone betwixt waggery and shame!
</p>

<p>
By the circumstances here enumerated as so
many predisposing causes, Edmund's character
might well be deemed already sufficiently explained;
and our minds prepared for it. But in
<pb n='191'/><anchor id='Pg191'/>
this tragedy the story or fable constrained Shakespeare
to introduce wickedness in an outrageous
form in the persons of Regan and Goneril. He
had read nature too heedfully not to know that
courage, intellect, and strength of character are
the most impressive forms of power, and that to
power in itself, without reference to any moral
end, an inevitable admiration and complacency
appertains, whether it be displayed in the conquests
of a Buonaparte or Tamerlane, or in the
foam and the thunder of a cataract. But in the
exhibition of such a character it was of the highest
importance to prevent the guilt from passing into
utter monstrosity,&mdash;which again depends on the
presence or absence of causes and temptations
sufficient to account for the wickedness, without
the necessity of recurring to a thorough fiendishness
of nature for its origination. For such are
the appointed relations of intellectual power to
truth, and of truth to goodness, that it becomes
both morally and poetically unsafe to present
what is admirable&mdash;what our nature compels us to
admire&mdash;in the mind, and what is most detestable
in the heart, as co-existing in the same individual
without any apparent connection, or any modification
of the one by the other. That Shakespeare
has in one instance, that of Iago, approached to
this, and that he has done it successfully, is
perhaps the most astonishing proof of his genius,
and the opulence of its resources. But in the
present tragedy, in which he was compelled to
present a Goneril and a Regan, it was most carefully
to be avoided;&mdash;and therefore the only one
conceivable addition to the inauspicious influences
on the preformation of Edmund's character is
<pb n='192'/><anchor id='Pg192'/>
given, in the information that all the kindly
counteractions to the mischievous feelings of
shame, which might have been derived from co-domestication
with Edgar and their common
father, had been cut off by his absence from home,
and foreign education from boyhood to the present
time, and a prospect of its continuance, as if to
preclude all risk of his interference with the
father's views for the elder and legitimate son:&mdash;

<p>
There is something of disgust at the ruthless
hypocrisy of her sisters, and some little faulty
admixture of pride and sullenness in Cordelia's
<q>Nothing;</q> and her tone is well contrived, indeed,
to lessen the glaring absurdity of Lear's
conduct, but answers the yet more important purpose
of forcing away the attention from the
nursery-tale, the moment it has served its end,
that of supplying the canvas for the picture. This
is also materially furthered by Kent's opposition,
which displays Lear's moral incapability of resigning
the sovereign power in the very act of disposing
of it. Kent is, perhaps, the nearest to
perfect goodness in all Shakespeare's characters,
and yet the most individualised. There is an
extraordinary charm, in his bluntness, which is
that only of a nobleman, arising from a contempt
of overstrained courtesy, and combined with easy
<pb n='193'/><anchor id='Pg193'/>
placability where goodness of heart is apparent.
His passionate affection for, and fidelity to, Lear
act on our feelings in Lear's own favour: virtue
itself seems to be in company with him.

<p>
Warburton's note upon a quotation from Vanini.
</p>

<p>
Poor Vanini!&mdash;Any one but Warburton would
have thought this precious passage more characteristic
of Mr. Shandy than of atheism. If the
fact really were so (which it is not, but almost the
contrary) I do not see why the most confirmed
theist might not very naturally utter the same
wish. But it is proverbial that the youngest son
in a large family is commonly the man of the
greatest talents in it; and as good an authority as
Vanini has said&mdash;<q>incalescere in venerem ardentius,
spei sobolis injuriosum esse.</q>
</p>

<p>
In this speech of Edmund you see, as soon as a
man cannot reconcile himself to reason, how his
conscience flies off by way of appeal to nature,
who is sure upon such occasions never to find
fault, and also how shame sharpens a predisposition
in the heart to evil. For it is a profound
moral, that shame will naturally generate guilt;
the oppressed will be vindictive, like Shylock, and
in the anguish of undeserved ignominy the delusion
secretly springs up of getting over the moral
quality of an action by fixing the mind on the
mere physical act alone.

Thus scorn and misanthropy are often the anticipations

exact antithesis to Kent, as the only character of
utter irredeemable baseness in Shakespeare. Even

tool of a Goneril be? Not a vice but this of baseness
was left open to him.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Ib.</hi> sc. 4. In Lear old age is itself a character,&mdash;its
natural imperfections being increased by
life-long habits of receiving a prompt obedience.
Any addition of individuality would have been
unnecessary and painful; for the relations of
others to him, of wondrous fidelity and of frightful
ingratitude, alone sufficiently distinguish him.
Thus Lear becomes the open and ample play-room
of nature's passions.

<p>
The Fool is no comic buffoon to make the
groundlings laugh,&mdash;no forced condescension of
Shakespeare's genius to the taste of his audience.
Accordingly the poet prepares for his introduction,
which he never does with any of his common
clowns and fools, by bringing him into living connection
with the pathos of the play. He is as
wonderful a creation as Caliban;&mdash;his wild babblings,
and inspired idiocy, articulate and gauge
the horrors of the scene.
</p>

<p>
The monster Goneril prepares what is necessary,
<pb n='195'/><anchor id='Pg195'/>
while the character of Albany renders a still more
maddening grievance possible&mdash;namely, Regan
and Cornwall in perfect sympathy of monstrosity.
Not a sentiment, not an image, which can give
pleasure on its own account is admitted; whenever
these creatures are introduced, and they are
brought forward as little as possible, pure horror
reigns throughout. In this scene and in all the
early speeches of Lear, the one general sentiment
of filial ingratitude prevails as the main-spring of
the feelings;&mdash;in this early stage the outward
object causing the pressure on the mind, which is
not yet sufficiently familiarised with the anguish
for the imagination to work upon it.

<p>
Observe the baffled endeavour of Goneril to act
on the fears of Albany, and yet his passiveness,
his <emph>inertia</emph>; he is not convinced, and yet he is
afraid of looking into the thing. Such characters
always yield to those who will take the trouble of
governing them, or for them. Perhaps the influence
of a princess, whose choice of him had
royalised his state, may be some little excuse for
Albany's weakness.

The mind's own anticipation of madness! The
deepest tragic notes are often struck by a half

of this act by a grotesque prattling seems to
<pb n='196'/><anchor id='Pg196'/>
indicate the dislocation of feeling that has begun
and is to be continued.

</lg>

<p>
and yet no reference to the guilt, but only to the
accident, which she uses as an occasion for sneering
at her father. Regan is not, in fact, a greater

casting more venom.

</lg>

<p>
In thus placing these profound general truths
in the mouths of such men as Cornwall, Edmund,

and yet shows how indefinite their application
is.

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Ib.</hi> sc. 3. Edgar's assumed madness serves the
great purpose of taking off part of the shock
which would otherwise be caused by the true
madness of Lear, and further displays the profound
difference between the two. In every
attempt at representing madness throughout the
<pb n='197'/><anchor id='Pg197'/>
whole range of dramatic literature, with the single
exception of Lear, it is mere lightheadedness, as
especially in Otway. In Edgar's ravings Shakespeare
all the while lets you see a fixed purpose, a
practical end in view;&mdash;in Lear's, there is only
the brooding of the one anguish, an eddy without
progression.

and indulgence the very reason for her frightful
conclusion&mdash;
</p>

<lg>

Act iii. sc. 4. O, what a world's convention of
agonies is here! All external nature in a storm,
all moral nature convulsed,&mdash;the real madness of
Lear, the feigned madness of Edgar, the babbling
of the Fool, the desperate fidelity of Kent&mdash;surely
such a scene was never conceived before or since!
Take it but as a picture for the eye only, it is
more terrific than any which a Michael Angelo,
inspired by a Dante, could have conceived, and
which none but a Michael Angelo could have
executed. Or let it have been uttered to the
blind, the howlings of nature would seem converted
into the voice of conscious humanity. This
scene ends with the first symptoms of positive
derangement; and the intervention of the fifth
scene is particularly judicious,&mdash;the interruption
allowing an interval for Lear to appear in full
madness in the sixth scene.

<head><q>Hamlet.</q></head>

<p>
Hamlet was the play, or rather Hamlet himself
was the character, in the intuition and
exposition of which I first made my turn for philosophical
criticism, and especially for insight into
the genius of Shakespeare, noticed. This happened
first amongst my acquaintances, as Sir George
Beaumont will bear witness; and subsequently,
long before Schlegel had delivered at Vienna the
lectures on Shakespeare, which he afterwards published,
I had given on the same subject eighteen
lectures substantially the same, proceeding from
the very same point of view, and deducing the
same conclusions, so far as I either then agreed,
or now agree, with him. I gave these lectures at
the Royal Institution, before six or seven hundred
auditors of rank and eminence, in the spring of the
same year, in which Sir Humphrey Davy, a fellow-lecturer,
made his great revolutionary discoveries
in chemistry. Even in detail the coincidence of
Schlegel with my lectures was so extraordinary,
that all who at a later period heard the same words,
taken by me from my notes of the lectures at the
Royal Institution, concluded a borrowing on my
part from Schlegel. Mr. Hazlitt, whose hatred of
me is in such an inverse ratio to my zealous kindness
towards him, as to be defended by his warmest
admirer, Charles Lamb&mdash;(who, God bless him!
besides his characteristic obstinacy of adherence to
old friends, as long at least as they are at all down
<pb n='202'/><anchor id='Pg202'/>
in the world, is linked as by a charm to Hazlitt's
conversation)&mdash;only as <q>frantic;</q>&mdash;Mr. Hazlitt, I
say, himself replied to an assertion of my plagiarism
from Schlegel in these words;&mdash;<q>That is a lie;
for I myself heard the very same character of
Hamlet from Coleridge before he went to Germany,
and when he had neither read nor could
read a page of German!</q> Now Hazlitt was on a
visit to me at my cottage at Nether Stowey, Somerset,
in the summer of the year 1798, in the September
of which year I first was out of sight of the
shores of Great Britain.&mdash;Recorded by me, S. T.
Coleridge, 7th January, 1819.
</p>

<p>
The seeming inconsistencies in the conduct and
character of Hamlet have long exercised the conjectural
ingenuity of critics; and, as we are always
loth to suppose that the cause of defective apprehension
is in ourselves, the mystery has been too
commonly explained by the very easy process of
setting it down as in fact inexplicable, and by resolving
the phenomenon into a misgrowth or <hi rend='italic'>lusus</hi>
of the capricious and irregular genius of Shakespeare.
The shallow and stupid arrogance of these
vulgar and indolent decisions I would fain do my
best to expose. I believe the character of Hamlet
may be traced to Shakespeare's deep and accurate
science in mental philosophy. Indeed, that this
character must have some connection with the
common fundamental laws of our nature may be
assumed from the fact, that Hamlet has been the
darling of every country in which the literature of
England has been fostered. In order to understand
him, it is essential that we should reflect on
the constitution of our own minds. Man is distinguished
from the brute animals in proportion as
<pb n='203'/><anchor id='Pg203'/>
thought prevails over sense: but in the healthy
processes of the mind, a balance is constantly maintained
between the impressions from outward objects
and the inward operations of the intellect;&mdash;for
if there be an overbalance in the contemplative
faculty, man thereby becomes the creature of mere
meditation, and loses his natural power of action.
Now one of Shakespeare's modes of creating characters
is, to conceive any one intellectual or moral
faculty in morbid excess, and then to place himself,
Shakespeare, thus mutilated or diseased, under given
circumstances. In Hamlet he seems to have wished
to exemplify the moral necessity of a due balance
between our attention to the objects of our senses,
and our meditation on the workings of our minds,&mdash;an
<emph>equilibrium</emph> between the real and the imaginary
worlds. In Hamlet this balance is disturbed: his
thoughts, and the images of his fancy, are far more
vivid than his actual perceptions, and his very perceptions,
instantly passing through the <emph>medium</emph> of
his contemplations, acquire, as they pass, a form
and a colour not naturally their own. Hence we
see a great, an almost enormous, intellectual activity,
and a proportionate aversion to real action,
consequent upon it, with all its symptoms and
accompanying qualities. This character Shakespeare
places in circumstances, under which it is
obliged to act on the spur of the moment:&mdash;Hamlet
is brave and careless of death; but he vacillates
from sensibility, and procrastinates from thought,
and loses the power of action in the energy of
resolve. Thus it is that this tragedy presents a
direct contrast to that of <hi rend='italic'>Macbeth</hi>; the one proceeds
with the utmost slowness, the other with a
crowded and breathless rapidity.
</p>

<pb n='204'/><anchor id='Pg204'/>

<p>
The effect of this overbalance of the imaginative
power is beautifully illustrated in the everlasting
broodings and superfluous activities of Hamlet's
mind, which, unseated from its healthy relation, is
constantly occupied with the world within, and abstracted
from the world without,&mdash;giving substance
to shadows, and throwing a mist over all commonplace
actualities. It is the nature of thought to be
indefinite;&mdash;definiteness belongs to external imagery
alone. Hence it is that the sense of sublimity
arises, not from the sight of an outward object,
but from the beholder's reflection upon it;&mdash;not
from the sensuous impression, but from the imaginative
reflex. Few have seen a celebrated waterfall
without feeling something akin to disappointment:
it is only subsequently that the image comes back
full into the mind, and brings with it a train of
grand or beautiful associations. Hamlet feels this;
his senses are in a state of trance, and he looks
upon external things as hieroglyphics. His soliloquy&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q>O! that this too too solid flesh would melt,</q> &amp;c.&mdash;</l>
</lg>

<p>
springs from that craving after the indefinite&mdash;for
that which is not&mdash;which most easily besets men
of genius; and the self-delusion common to this
temper of mind is finely exemplified in the character
which Hamlet gives of himself;&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 10">... <q rend="pre">It cannot be</q></l>
<l>But I am pigeon-liver'd, and lack gall</l>
<l><q rend="post">To make oppression bitter.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
He mistakes the seeing his chains for the breaking
them, delays action till action is of no use, and dies
the victim of mere circumstance and accident.
</p>

<p>
There is a great significancy in the names of
Shakespeare's plays. In the <hi rend='italic'>Twelfth Night</hi>,
<hi rend='italic'>Midsummer
<pb n='205'/><anchor id='Pg205'/>
Night's Dream</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>As You Like It</hi>, and
<hi rend='italic'>Winter's Tale</hi>, the total effect is produced by a
co-ordination of the characters as in a wreath of
flowers. But in <hi rend='italic'>Coriolanus</hi>,
<hi rend='italic'>Lear</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>Romeo and Juliet</hi>,
<hi rend='italic'>Hamlet</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>Othello</hi>, &amp;c.,
the effect arises from the subordination
of all to one, either as the prominent
person, or the principal object. <hi rend='italic'>Cymbeline</hi> is the
only exception; and even that has its advantages
in preparing the audience for the chaos of time,
place, and costume, by throwing the date back
into a fabulous king's reign.
</p>

<p>
But as of more importance, so more striking, is
the judgment displayed by our truly dramatic poet,
as well as poet of the drama, in the management
of his first scenes. With the single exception of
<hi rend='italic'>Cymbeline</hi>, they either place before us at one glance
both the past and the future in some effect, which
implies the continuance and full agency of its cause,
as in the feuds and party-spirit of the servants of
the two houses in the first scene of <hi rend='italic'>Romeo and
Juliet</hi>; or in the degrading passion for shows and
public spectacles, and the overwhelming attachment
for the newest successful war-chief in the
Roman people, already become a populace, contrasted
with the jealousy of the nobles in <hi rend='italic'>Julius
Cæsar</hi>;&mdash;or they at once commence the action so
as to excite a curiosity for the explanation in the
following scenes, as in the storm of wind and waves,
and the boatswain in the <hi rend='italic'>Tempest</hi>, instead of anticipating
our curiosity, as in most other first scenes,
and in too many other first acts;&mdash;or they act, by
contrast of diction suited to the characters, at once
to heighten the effect, and yet to give a naturalness
to the language and rhythm of the principal personages,
either as that of Prospero and Miranda
<pb n='206'/><anchor id='Pg206'/>
by the appropriate lowness of the style, or as in
<hi rend='italic'>King John</hi>, by the equally appropriate stateliness
of official harangues or narratives, so that the after
blank verse seems to belong to the rank and quality
of the speakers, and not to the poet;&mdash;or they
strike at once the key-note, and give the predominant
spirit of the play, as in the <hi rend='italic'>Twelfth Night</hi> and
in <hi rend='italic'>Macbeth</hi>;&mdash;or finally, the first scene comprises
all these advantages at once, as in <hi rend='italic'>Hamlet</hi>.
</p>

<p>
Compare the easy language of common life, in
which this drama commences, with the direful music
and wild wayward rhythm and abrupt lyrics of
the opening of <hi rend='italic'>Macbeth</hi>. The tone is quite familiar;&mdash;there
is no poetic description of night, no elaborate
information conveyed by one speaker to another
of what both had immediately before their senses&mdash;(such
as the first distich in Addison's <hi rend='italic'>Cato</hi>, which
is a translation into poetry of <q>Past four o'clock
and a dark morning!</q>);&mdash;and yet nothing bordering
on the comic on the one hand, nor any striving
of the intellect on the other. It is precisely the
language of sensation among men who feared no
charge of effeminacy for feeling what they had no
want of resolution to bear. Yet the armour, the
dead silence, the watchfulness that first interrupts
it, the welcome relief of the guard, the cold, the
broken expressions of compelled attention to bodily
feelings still under control&mdash;all excellently accord
with, and prepare for, the after gradual rise into
tragedy;&mdash;but, above all, into a tragedy, the interest
of which is as eminently <hi rend='italic'>ad et apud intra</hi>, as
that of <hi rend='italic'>Macbeth</hi> is directly <hi rend='italic'>ad extra</hi>.
</p>

<p>
In all the best attested stories of ghosts and
visions, as in that of Brutus, of Archbishop Cranmer,
that of Benvenuto Cellini recorded by himself,
<pb n='207'/><anchor id='Pg207'/>
and the vision of Galileo communicated by him to
his favourite pupil Torricelli, the ghost-seers were
in a state of cold or chilling damp from without,
and of anxiety inwardly. It has been with all of
them as with Francisco on his guard,&mdash;alone, in
the depth and silence of the night; <q>'twas bitter
cold, and they were sick at heart, and <emph>not a mouse
stirring</emph>.</q> The attention to minute sounds,&mdash;naturally
associated with the recollection of minute
objects, and the more familiar and trifling, the more
impressive from the unusualness of their producing
any impression at all&mdash;gives a philosophic pertinency
to this last image; but it has likewise its
dramatic use and purpose. For its commonness in
ordinary conversation tends to produce the sense of
reality, and at once hides the poet, and yet approximates
the reader or spectator to that state in which
the highest poetry will appear, and in its component
parts, though not in the whole composition, really
is, the language of nature. If I should not speak
it, I feel that I should be thinking it;&mdash;the voice
only is the poet's,&mdash;the words are my own. That
Shakespeare meant to put an effect in the actor's
power in the very first words&mdash;<q>Who's there?</q>&mdash;is
evident from the impatience expressed by the
startled Francisco in the words that follow&mdash;<q>Nay,
answer me: stand and unfold yourself.</q> A brave
man is never so peremptory, as when he fears that
he is afraid. Observe the gradual transition from
the silence and the still recent habit of listening in
Francisco's&mdash;<q>I think I hear them</q>&mdash;to the more
cheerful call out, which a good actor would observe,
in the&mdash;<q>Stand ho! Who is there?</q> Bernardo's
inquiry after Horatio, and the repetition of his
name and in his own presence indicate a respect or
<pb n='208'/><anchor id='Pg208'/>
an eagerness that implies him as one of the persons
who are in the foreground; and the scepticism
attributed to him,&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">Horatio says, 'tis but our fantasy;</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">And will not let belief take hold of him,</q>&mdash;</l>
</lg>

<p>
prepares us for Hamlet's after eulogy on him as
one whose blood and judgment were happily commingled.
The actor should also be careful to distinguish
the expectation and gladness of Bernardo's
<q>Welcome, Horatio!</q> from the mere courtesy of
his <q>Welcome, good Marcellus!</q>
</p>

<p>
Now observe the admirable indefiniteness of the
first opening out of the occasion of all this anxiety.
The preparation informative of the audience is just
as much as was precisely necessary, and no more;&mdash;it
begins with the uncertainty appertaining to
a question:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q><hi rend='italic'>Mar.</hi> What, has <emph>this thing</emph>
appear'd again to-night?</q>&mdash;</l>
</lg>

<p>
Even the word <q>again</q> has its <emph>credibilising</emph> effect.
Then Horatio, the representative of the ignorance
of the audience, not himself, but by Marcellus to
Bernardo, anticipates the common solution&mdash;<q>'tis
but our fantasy!</q> upon which Marcellus rises
into&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q>This dreaded sight, twice seen of us</q>&mdash;</l>
</lg>

<p>
which immediately afterwards becomes <q>this apparition,</q>
and that, too, an intelligent spirit&mdash;that
is, to be spoken to! Then comes the confirmation
of Horatio's disbelief;&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q>Tush! tush! 'twill not appear!</q>&mdash;</l>
</lg>

<p>
and the silence, with which the scene opened, is
again restored in the shivering feeling of Horatio
sitting down, at such a time, and with the two
eye-witnesses, to hear a story of a ghost, and that,
<pb n='209'/><anchor id='Pg209'/>
too, of a ghost which had appeared twice before at
the very same hour. In the deep feeling which
Bernardo has of the solemn nature of what he is
about to relate, he makes an effort to master his
own imaginative terrors by an elevation of style,&mdash;itself
a continuation of the effort,&mdash;and by turning
off from the apparition, as from something
which would force him too deeply into himself, to
the outward objects, the realities of nature, which
had accompanied it:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre"><hi rend='italic'>Ber.</hi> Last night of all,</q></l>
<l>When yon same star, that's westward from the pole</l>
<l>Had made his course to illume that part of heaven</l>
<l>Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,</l>
<l><q rend="post">The bell then beating one.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
This passage seems to contradict the critical
law that what is told, makes a faint impression
compared with what is beholden; for it does
indeed convey to the mind more than the eye can
see; whilst the interruption of the narrative at the
very moment when we are most intensely listening
for the sequel, and have our thoughts diverted
from the dreaded sight in expectation of the
desired, yet almost dreaded, tale&mdash;this gives all
the suddenness and surprise of the original appearance:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q><hi rend='italic'>Mar.</hi> Peace, break thee off;
look, where it comes again!</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
Note the judgment displayed in having the two
persons present, who, as having seen the Ghost
before, are naturally eager in confirming their
former opinions,&mdash;whilst the sceptic is silent, and
after having been twice addressed by his friends,
answers with two hasty syllables&mdash;<q>Most like,</q>&mdash;and
a confession of horror:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q>It harrows me with fear and wonder.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
O heaven! words are wasted on those who feel,
<pb n='210'/><anchor id='Pg210'/>
and to those who do not feel the exquisite judgment
of Shakespeare in this scene, what can be
said? Hume himself could not but have had
faith in this Ghost dramatically, let his anti-ghostism
have been as strong as Sampson against
other ghosts less powerfully raised.
</p>

<p>
Act i. sc. 1.&mdash;

me, he that knows,</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">Why this same strict and most observant watch,</q> &amp;c.</l>
</lg>

<p>
How delightfully natural is the transition, to the
retrospective narrative! And observe, upon the
Ghost's reappearance, how much Horatio's courage
is increased by having translated the late individual
spectator into general thought and past
experience,&mdash;and the sympathy of Marcellus and
Bernardo with his patriotic surmises in daring to
strike at the Ghost; whilst in a moment, upon its
vanishing, the former solemn awe-stricken feeling
returns upon them:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">We do it wrong, being so majestical,</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">To offer it the show of violence.</q></l>

</lg>

<p>
No Addison could be more careful to be poetical
in diction than Shakespeare in providing the
grounds and sources of its propriety. But how to
elevate a thing almost mean by its familiarity,
young poets may learn in this treatment of the
cock-crow.

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Ib.</hi> sc. 2. The audience are now relieved by a
change of scene to the royal court, in order that
Hamlet may not have to take up the leavings of
exhaustion. In the king's speech, observe the set
and pedantically antithetic form of the sentences
when touching that which galled the heels of conscience,&mdash;the
strain of undignified rhetoric,&mdash;and
yet in what follows concerning the public weal, a
certain appropriate majesty. Indeed was he not a

Thus with great art Shakespeare introduces a most
important, but still subordinate character first,
Laertes, who is yet thus graciously treated in consequence
of the assistance given to the election
of the late king's brother instead of his son by
Polonius.

Hamlet opens his mouth with a playing on
words, the complete absence of which throughout
characterises Macbeth. This playing on words
may be attributed to many causes or motives, as
either to an exuberant activity of mind, as in the
higher comedy of Shakespeare generally;&mdash;or to an
imitation of it as a mere fashion, as if it were said&mdash;<q>Is
not this better than groaning?</q>&mdash;or to a contemptuous
<pb n='212'/><anchor id='Pg212'/>
exultation in minds vulgarised and overset
by their success, as in the poetic instance of
Milton's Devils in the battle;&mdash;or it is the language
of resentment, as is familiar to every one who has
witnessed the quarrels of the lower orders, where
there is invariably a profusion of punning invective,
whence, perhaps, nicknames have in a considerable
degree sprung up;&mdash;or it is the language
of suppressed passion, and especially of a hardly
smothered personal dislike. The first and last of
these combine in Hamlet's case; and I have little
doubt that Farmer is right in supposing the equivocation
carried on in the expression <q>too much i'
the sun,</q> or son.

<l><q><hi rend='italic'>Ham.</hi> Ay, madam, it is common.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
Here observe Hamlet's delicacy to his mother, and
how the suppression prepares him for the overflow
in the next speech, in which his character is more
developed by bringing forward his aversion to externals,
and which betrays his habit of brooding
over the world within him, coupled with a prodigality
of beautiful words, which are the half embodyings
of thought, and are more than thought,
and have an outness, a reality <hi rend='italic'>sui generis</hi>, and yet
retain their correspondence and shadowy affinity
to the images and movements within. Note also
Hamlet's silence to the long speech of the king
which follows, and his respectful, but general,
answer to his mother.

</lg>

<p>
This <hi rend='italic'>tædium vitæ</hi> is a common oppression on
minds cast in the Hamlet mould, and is caused by
<pb n='213'/><anchor id='Pg213'/>
disproportionate mental exertion, which necessitates
exhaustion of bodily feeling. Where there
is a just coincidence of external and internal
action, pleasure is always the result; but where
the former is deficient, and the mind's appetency
of the ideal is unchecked, realities will seem cold
and unmoving. In such cases, passion combines
itself with the indefinite alone. In this mood of
his mind the relation of the appearance of his
father's spirit in arms is made all at once to
Hamlet:&mdash;it is&mdash;Horatio's speech in particular&mdash;a
perfect model of the true style of dramatic narrative;&mdash;the
purest poetry, and yet in the most
natural language, equally remote from the ink-horn
and the plough.

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Ib.</hi> sc. 3. This scene must be regarded as one
of Shakespeare's lyric movements in the play, and
the skill with which it is interwoven with the
dramatic parts is peculiarly an excellence of our
poet. You experience the sensation of a pause
without the sense of a stop. You will observe in
Ophelia's short and general answer to the long
speech of Laertes the natural carelessness of innocence,
which cannot think such a code of cautions
and prudences necessary to its own preservation.

<p>
Shakespeare never introduces a catalectic line
without intending an equivalent to the foot omitted
in the pauses, or the dwelling emphasis, or the
diffused retardation. I do not, however, deny that
a good actor might, by employing the last mentioned
means&mdash;namely, the retardation, or solemn
knowing drawl&mdash;supply the missing spondee with
good effect. But I do not believe that in this or
any other of the foregoing speeches of Polonius,
Shakespeare meant to bring out the senility or
weakness of that personage's mind. In the great
ever-recurring dangers and duties of life, where
to distinguish the fit objects for the application of
the maxims collected by the experience of a long
life, requires no fineness of tact, as in the admonitions
to his son and daughter, Polonius is uniformly
made respectable. But if an actor were
even capable of catching these shades in the character,
the pit and the gallery would be malcontent
at their exhibition. It is to Hamlet that Polonius
is, and is meant to be, contemptible, because in
inwardness and uncontrollable activity of movement,
Hamlet's mind is the logical contrary to
that of Polonius; and besides, as I have observed
before, Hamlet dislikes the man as false to his true
allegiance in the matter of the succession to the
crown.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Ib.</hi> sc. 4. The unimportant conversation with
which this scene opens is a proof of Shakespeare's
<pb n='215'/><anchor id='Pg215'/>
minute knowledge of human nature. It is a well
established fact, that on the brink of any serious
enterprise, or event of moment, men almost invariably
endeavour to elude the pressure of their
own thoughts by turning aside to trivial objects
and familiar circumstances: thus this dialogue on
the platform begins with remarks on the coldness
of the air, and inquiries, obliquely connected,
indeed, with the expected hour of the visitation,
but thrown out in a seeming vacuity of topics, as
to the striking of the clock and so forth. The
same desire to escape from the impending thought
is carried on in Hamlet's account of, and moralizing
on, the Danish custom of wassailing: he runs off
from the particular to the universal, and, in his
repugnance to personal and individual concerns,
escapes, as it were, from himself in generalisations,
and smothers the impatience and uneasy feelings
of the moment in abstract reasoning. Besides
this, another purpose is answered;&mdash;for by thus
entangling the attention of the audience in the
nice distinctions and parenthetical sentences of
this speech of Hamlet's, Shakespeare takes them
completely by surprise on the appearance of the
Ghost, which comes upon them in all the suddenness
of its visionary character. Indeed, no modern
writer would have dared, like Shakespeare, to have
preceded this last visitation by two distinct appearances,&mdash;or
could have contrived that the third
should rise upon the former two in impressiveness
and solemnity of interest.
</p>

<p>
But in addition to all the other excellences of
Hamlet's speech concerning the wassail-music&mdash;so
finely revealing the predominant idealism, the
ratiocinative meditativeness, of his character&mdash;it
<pb n='216'/><anchor id='Pg216'/>
has the advantage of giving nature and probability
to the impassioned continuity of the speech
instantly directed to the Ghost. The <emph>momentum</emph>
had been given to his mental activity; the full
current of the thoughts and words had set in, and
the very forgetfulness, in the fervour of his argumentation,
of the purpose for which he was there,
aided in preventing the appearance from benumbing
the mind. Consequently, it acted as a new
impulse,&mdash;a sudden stroke which increased the
velocity of the body already in motion, whilst it
altered the direction. The co-presence of Horatio,
Marcellus, and Bernardo is most judiciously contrived;
for it renders the courage of Hamlet, and
his impetuous eloquence, perfectly intelligible.
The knowledge,&mdash;the unthought of consciousness,&mdash;the
sensation of human auditors&mdash;of flesh and
blood sympathists&mdash;acts as a support and a stimulation
<hi rend='italic'>a tergo</hi>, while the front of the mind, the
whole consciousness of the speaker, is filled, yea,
absorbed, by the apparition. Add too, that the
apparition itself has, by its previous appearances,
been brought nearer to a thing of this world.
This accrescence of objectivity in a Ghost that yet
retains all its ghostly attributes and fearful subjectivity,
is truly wonderful.

I remember nothing equal to this burst, unless
it be the first speech of Prometheus in the Greek
drama, after the exit of Vulcan and the two
Afrites. But Shakespeare alone could have produced
the vow of Hamlet to make his memory a
blank of all maxims and generalised truths, that

<p>
This part of the scene, after Hamlet's interview
with the Ghost, has been charged with an improbable
eccentricity. But the truth is, that after the
mind has been stretched beyond its usual pitch
and tone, it must either sink into exhaustion and
inanity, or seek relief by change. It is thus well
known, that persons conversant in deeds of cruelty
contrive to escape from conscience by connecting
something of the ludicrous with them, and by inventing
grotesque terms, and a certain technical
phraseology, to disguise the horror of their practices.
Indeed, paradoxical as it may appear, the
terrible by a law of the human mind always
touches on the verge of the ludicrous. Both arise
from the perception of something out of the
common order of things&mdash;something, in fact, out
of its place; and if from this we can abstract
danger, the uncommonness will alone remain, and
the sense of the ridiculous be excited. The close
alliance of these opposites&mdash;they are not contraries&mdash;appears
from the circumstance, that laughter is
equally the expression of extreme anguish and
horror as of joy: as there are tears of sorrow and
tears of joy, so is there a laugh of terror and a
laugh of merriment. These complex causes will
naturally have produced in Hamlet the disposition
to escape from his own feelings of the overwhelming
and supernatural by a wild transition
<pb n='218'/><anchor id='Pg218'/>
to the ludicrous,&mdash;a sort of cunning bravado,
bordering on the flights of delirium. For you
may, perhaps, observe that Hamlet's wildness is
but half false; he plays that subtle trick of pretending
to act only when he is very near really
being what he acts.
</p>

<p>
The subterraneous speeches of the Ghost are
hardly defensible;&mdash;but I would call your attention
to the characteristic difference between this Ghost,
as a superstition connected with the most mysterious
truths of revealed religion,&mdash;and Shakespeare's
consequent reverence in his treatment of
it,&mdash;and the foul earthly witcheries and wild
language in <hi rend='italic'>Macbeth</hi>.
</p>

<p>
Act ii. sc. 1. Polonius and Reynaldo.
</p>

<p>
In all things dependent on, or rather made up
of, fine address, the manner is no more or otherwise
rememberable than the light notions, steps, and
gestures of youth and health. But this is almost
everything:&mdash;no wonder, therefore, if that which
can be put down by rule in the memory should
appear to us as mere poring, maudlin, cunning,&mdash;slyness
blinking through the watery eye of superannuation.
So in this admirable scene, Polonius,
who is throughout the skeleton of his own former
skill and statecraft, hunts the trail of policy at a
dead scent, supplied by the weak fever-smell in his
own nostrils.

These purposely obscure lines, I rather think, refer
to some thought in Hamlet's mind, contrasting the
lovely daughter with such a tedious old fool, her
father, as he, Hamlet, represents Polonius to himself:&mdash;<q>Why,
fool as he is, he is some degrees in
rank above a dead dog's carcase; and if the sun,
being a god that kisses carrion, can raise life out of
a dead dog,&mdash;why may not good fortune, that
favours fools, have raised a lovely girl out of this
dead-alive old fool?</q> Warburton is often led
astray, in his interpretations, by his attention to
general positions without the due Shakespearian
reference to what is probably passing in the mind
of his speaker, characteristic, and expository of his
particular character and present mood. The subsequent
passage,&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q>O Jephthah, judge of Israel! what a treasure hadst thou!</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
is confirmatory of my view of these lines.

<p>
This admirable substitution of the epic for the
dramatic, giving such a reality to the impassioned
dramatic diction of Shakespeare's own dialogue,
and authorised too, by the actual style of the
tragedies before his time (<hi rend='italic'>Porrex and Ferrex</hi>,
<hi rend='italic'>Titus Andronicus</hi>, &amp;c.)&mdash;is well worthy of notice. The
fancy, that a burlesque was intended, sinks below
criticism: the lines, as epic narrative, are superb.
</p>

<p>
In the thoughts, and even in the separate parts
of the diction, this description is highly poetical:
in truth, taken by itself, that is its fault that it is
too poetical!&mdash;the language of lyric vehemence and
epic pomp, and not of the drama. But if Shakespeare
had made the diction truly dramatic, where

Here it is evident that the penetrating Hamlet
perceives, from the strange and forced manner of
Ophelia, that the sweet girl was not acting a part
of her own, but was a decoy; and his after speeches
are not so much directed to her as to the listeners
and spies. Such a discovery in a mood so anxious
and irritable accounts for a certain harshness in
him;&mdash;and yet a wild up-working of love, sporting
with opposites in a wilful self-tormenting strain of
irony, is perceptible throughout. <q>I did love you
once:</q>&mdash;<q>I lov'd you not:</q>&mdash;and particularly in
his enumeration of the faults of the sex from which
Ophelia is so free, that the mere freedom therefrom
constitutes her character. Note Shakespeare's
charm of composing the female character by the
absence of characters, that is, marks and out-juttings.

<p>
The utmost at which Hamlet arrives, is a disposition,
a mood, to do something:&mdash;but what to do,
is still left undecided, while every word he utters
tends to betray his disguise. Yet observe how
perfectly equal to any call of the moment is Hamlet,
let it only not be for the future.

<hi rend='italic'>Ib.</hi> sc. 3. Speech of Polonius. Polonius's volunteer
obtrusion of himself into this business, while
it is appropriate to his character, still itching after
former importance, removes all likelihood that
Hamlet should suspect his presence, and prevents
us from making his death injure Hamlet in our
opinion.

<p>
This speech well marks the difference between
crime and guilt of habit. The conscience here is
still admitted to audience. Nay, even as an audible
soliloquy, it is far less improbable than is supposed
by such as have watched men only in the beaten
road of their feelings. But the final&mdash;<q>all may
be well!</q> is remarkable;&mdash;the degree of merit
attributed by the self-flattering soul to its own
struggle, though baffled, and to the indefinite half-promise,
half-command, to persevere in religious
duties. The solution is in the divine <emph>medium</emph> of the
Christian doctrine of expiation:&mdash;not what you
have done, but what you are, must determine.

lately expressed, and the fears not too delicately
avowed, by her father and brother, concerning the
dangers to which her honour lay exposed. Thought,
affliction, passion, murder itself&mdash;she turns to favour
and prettiness. This play of association is instanced
in the close:&mdash;

Yet I acknowledge that Shakespeare evidently
wishes, as much as possible, to spare the character
of Laertes,&mdash;to break the extreme turpitude of his
consent to become an agent and accomplice of the
King's treachery;&mdash;and to this end he re-introduces
Ophelia at the close of this scene to afford a

<p>
Theobald's note from Warburton, who conjectures
<q>plethory.</q>
</p>

<p>
I rather think that Shakespeare meant <q>pleurisy,</q>
but involved in it the thought of <emph>plethora</emph>, as
supposing pleurisy to arise from too much blood;
otherwise I cannot explain the following line&mdash;
</p>

called the <q>plethory.</q>

<p>
That Laertes might be excused in some degree for
not cooling, the Act concludes with the affecting
death of Ophelia,&mdash;who in the beginning lay like
a little projection of land into a lake or stream,
covered with spray-flowers, quietly reflected in
the quiet waters, but at length is undermined or
loosened, and becomes a faery isle, and after a brief
vagrancy sinks almost without an eddy!

Act v. sc. 1. O, the rich contrast between the

the dialogue with Horatio, his fine gentlemanly
manners with Osrick, and his and Shakespeare's

<head><q>Macbeth.</q></head>

<p>
<q>Macbeth</q> stands in contrast throughout
with <hi rend='italic'>Hamlet</hi>; in the manner of opening
more especially. In the latter, there is a gradual
ascent from the simplest forms of conversation to
the language of impassioned intellect,&mdash;yet the
intellect still remaining the seat of passion: in
the former, the invocation is at once made to the
imagination and the emotions connected therewith.
Hence the movement throughout is the
most rapid of all Shakespeare's plays; and hence
also, with the exception of the disgusting passage
of the Porter (Act ii. sc. 3), which I dare pledge
myself to demonstrate to be an interpolation of
the actors, there is not, to the best of my remembrance,
a single pun or play on words in the whole
drama. I have previously given an answer to the
thousand times repeated charge against Shakespeare
upon the subject of his punning, and I here
merely mention the fact of the absence of any
puns in <hi rend='italic'>Macbeth</hi>, as justifying a candid doubt, at
least, whether even in these figures of speech and
fanciful modifications of language, Shakespeare
may not have followed rules and principles that
merit and would stand the test of philosophic
examination. And hence, also, there is an entire
absence of comedy, nay, even of irony and philosophic
contemplation in <hi rend='italic'>Macbeth</hi>,&mdash;the play being
wholly and purely tragic. For the same cause,
<pb n='230'/><anchor id='Pg230'/>
there are no reasonings of equivocal morality,
which would have required a more leisurely state
and a consequently greater activity of mind;&mdash;no
sophistry of self-delusion,&mdash;except only that previously
to the dreadful act, Macbeth mistranslates
the recoilings and ominous whispers of conscience
into prudential and selfish reasonings; and, after
the deed done, the terrors of remorse into fear
from external dangers,&mdash;like delirious men who
run away from the phantoms of their own brains,
or, raised by terror to rage, stab the real object
that is within their reach:&mdash;whilst Lady Macbeth
merely endeavours to reconcile his and her own
sinkings of heart by anticipations of the worst,
and an affected bravado in confronting them. In
all the rest, Macbeth's language is the grave
utterance of the very heart, conscience-sick, even
to the last faintings of moral death. It is the
same in all the other characters. The variety
arises from rage, caused ever and anon by disruption
of anxious thought, and the quick transition
of fear into it.
</p>

<p>
In <hi rend='italic'>Hamlet</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>Macbeth</hi> the scene opens with
superstition; but, in each it is not merely different,
but opposite. In the first it is connected with the
best and holiest feelings; in the second with the
shadowy, turbulent, and unsanctified cravings of
the individual will. Nor is the purpose the same;
in the one the object is to excite, whilst in the
other it is to mark a mind already excited.
Superstition, of one sort or another, is natural
to victorious generals; the instances are too
notorious to need mentioning. There is so much
of chance in warfare, and such vast events are
connected with the acts of a single individual,&mdash;the
<pb n='231'/><anchor id='Pg231'/>
representative, in truth, of the efforts of
myriads, and yet to the public, and doubtless to
his own feelings, the aggregate of all,&mdash;that the
proper temperament for generating or receiving
superstitious impressions is naturally produced.
Hope, the master element of a commanding genius,
meeting with an active and combining intellect,
and an imagination of just that degree of vividness
which disquiets and impels the soul to try to
realise its images, greatly increases the creative
power of the mind; and hence the images become
a satisfying world of themselves, as is the case in
every poet and original philosopher:&mdash;but hope
fully gratified, and yet the elementary basis of the
passion remaining, becomes fear; and, indeed, the
general, who must often feel, even though he may
hide it from his own consciousness, how large a
share chance had in his successes, may very naturally
be irresolute in a new scene, where he knows
that all will depend on his own act and election.
</p>

<p>
The Weird Sisters are as true a creation of
Shakespeare's, as his Ariel and Caliban,&mdash;fates,
furies, and materialising witches being the elements.
They are wholly different from any representation
of witches in the contemporary
writers, and yet presented a sufficient external resemblance
to the creatures of vulgar prejudice to
act immediately on the audience. Their character
consists in the imaginative disconnected from the
good; they are the shadowy obscure and fearfully
anomalous of physical nature, the lawless of
human nature,&mdash;elemental avengers without sex
or kin:&mdash;

<p>
How much it were to be wished in playing <hi rend='italic'>Macbeth</hi>,
that an attempt should be made to introduce
the flexile character-mask of the ancient pantomime;&mdash;that
Flaxman would contribute his genius
to the embodying and making sensuously perceptible
that of Shakespeare!
</p>

<p>
The style and rhythm of the Captain's speeches
in the second scene should be illustrated by reference
to the interlude in <hi rend='italic'>Hamlet</hi>, in which the epic
is substituted for the tragic, in order to make the
latter be felt as the real-life diction. In <hi rend='italic'>Macbeth</hi>
the poet's object was to raise the mind at once to
the high tragic tone, that the audience might be
ready for the precipitate consummation of guilt in
the early part of the play. The true reason for
the first appearance of the Witches is to strike
the key-note of the character of the whole drama,
as is proved by their re-appearance in the third
scene, after such an order of the king's as establishes
their supernatural power of information. I
say information,&mdash;for so it only is as to Glamis
and Cawdor; the <q>king hereafter</q> was still contingent,&mdash;still
in Macbeth's moral will; although,
if he should yield to the temptation, and thus
forfeit his free agency, the link of cause and effect
<hi rend='italic'>more physico</hi> would then commence. I need not
say, that the general idea is all that can be required
from the poet,&mdash;not a scholastic logical
consistency in all the parts so as to meet metaphysical
objectors. But O! how truly Shakespearian
is the opening of Macbeth's character
given in the <emph>unpossessedness</emph> of Banquo's mind,
wholly present to the present object,&mdash;an unsullied,
unscarified mirror! And how strictly
true to nature it is that Banquo, and not Macbeth
<pb n='233'/><anchor id='Pg233'/>
himself, directs our notice to the effect produced
on Macbeth's mind, rendered temptible by previous
dalliance of the fancy with ambitious
thoughts:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">Good Sir, why do you start; and seem to fear</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">Things that do sound so fair?</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
And then, again, still unintroitive, addresses the
Witches:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 6">... <q rend="pre">I' the name of truth,</q></l>
<l>Are ye fantastical, or that indeed</l>
<l><q rend="post">Which outwardly ye show?</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
Banquo's questions are those of natural curiosity,&mdash;such
as a girl would put after hearing a gipsy
tell her schoolfellow's fortune;&mdash;all perfectly
general, or rather, planless. But Macbeth, lost
in thought, raises himself to speech only by the
Witches being about to depart:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q>Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:</q>&mdash;</l>
</lg>

<p>
and all that follows is reasoning on a problem
already discussed in his mind,&mdash;on a hope which
he welcomes, and the doubts concerning the
attainment of which he wishes to have cleared up.
Compare his eagerness,&mdash;the keen eye with which
he has pursued the Witches' evanishing&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q>Speak, I charge you!</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
with the easily satisfied mind of the self-uninterested
Banquo:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">The air hath bubbles, as the water has,</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">And these are of them:&mdash;Whither are they vanish'd?</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
and then Macbeth's earnest reply,&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">Into the air; and what seem'd corporal, melted</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">As breath into the wind.&mdash;<emph>Would they had
stay'd!</emph></q></l>
</lg>

<p>
Is it too minute to notice the appropriateness of
the simile <q>as breath,</q> &amp;c., in a cold climate?
</p>

<pb n='234'/><anchor id='Pg234'/>

<p>
Still again Banquo goes on wondering like any
common spectator,&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q>Were such things here as we do speak about?</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
whilst Macbeth persists in recurring to the self-concerning:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">Your children shall be kings.</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l><hi rend='italic'>Ban.</hi> You shall be king.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l><q rend="post"><hi rend='italic'>Macb.</hi> And thane of Cawdor too: went it
not so?</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
So surely is the guilt in its germ anterior to the
supposed cause, and immediate temptation! Before
he can cool, the confirmation of the tempting half
of the prophecy arrives, and the concatenating
tendency of the imagination is fostered by the
sudden coincidence:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">Glamis, and thane of Cawdor:</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">The greatest is behind.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
Oppose this to Banquo's simple surprise:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q>What, can the devil speak true?</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Ib.</hi> Banquo's speech:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">That, trusted home,</q></l>
<l>Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Besides the thane of Cawdor.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
I doubt whether <q>enkindle</q> has not another
sense than that of <q>stimulating;</q> I mean of
<q>kind</q> and <q>kin,</q> as when rabbits are said to
<q>kindle.</q> However, Macbeth no longer hears

<p>
Then in the necessity of recollecting himself,&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q>I thank you, gentlemen.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
Then he relapses into himself again, and every
word of his soliloquy shows the early birth-date of
his guilt. He is all-powerful without strength;
<pb n='235'/><anchor id='Pg235'/>
he wishes the end, but is irresolute as to the
means; conscience distinctly warns him, and he
lulls it imperfectly:&mdash;

<l><q rend="pre">If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">Without my stir.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
Lost in the prospective of his guilt, he turns round
alarmed lest others may suspect what is passing
in his own mind, and instantly vents the lie of

Duncan's <q>plenteous joys,</q> Macbeth has nothing
but the common-places of loyalty, in which he hides
himself with <q>our duties.</q> Note the exceeding
effort of Macbeth's addresses to the king, his
reasoning on his allegiance, and then especially
when a new difficulty, the designation of a successor,
suggests a new crime. This, however, seems
the first distinct notion, as to the plan of realising
his wishes; and here, therefore, with great propriety,
Macbeth's cowardice of his own conscience
discloses itself. I always think there is something
especially Shakespearian in Duncan's speeches
throughout this scene, such pourings forth, such
abandonments, compared with the language of
vulgar dramatists, whose characters seem to have
made their speeches as the actors learn them.

It is a fancy;&mdash;but I can never read this and
the following speeches of Macbeth, without involuntarily
thinking of the Miltonic Messiah and
Satan.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Ib.</hi> sc. 5. Macbeth is described by Lady Macbeth
so as at the same time to reveal her own
character. Could he have every thing he wanted,
he would rather have it innocently;&mdash;ignorant, as
alas! how many of us are, that he who wishes a
temporal end for itself, does in truth will the
means; and hence the danger of indulging fancies.
</p>

<pb n='237'/><anchor id='Pg237'/>

<p>
Lady Macbeth, like all in Shakespeare, is a class
individualised:&mdash;of high rank, left much alone,
and feeding herself with day-dreams of ambition,
she mistakes the courage of fantasy for the power
of bearing the consequences of the realities of guilt.
His is the mock fortitude of a mind deluded by
ambition; she shames her husband with a superhuman
audacity of fancy which she cannot support,
but sinks in the season of remorse, and dies in
suicidal agony. Her speech:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 10">... <q rend="pre">Come, you spirits</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,</q> &amp;c.&mdash;</l>
</lg>

<p>
is that of one who had habitually familiarised her
imagination to dreadful conceptions, and was trying
to do so still more. Her invocations and
requisitions are all the false efforts of a mind
accustomed only hitherto to the shadows of the
imagination, vivid enough to throw the every-day
substances of life into shadow, but never as yet
brought into direct contact with their own correspondent
realities. She evinces no womanly life,
no wifely joy, at the return of her husband, no
pleased terror at the thought of his past dangers,
whilst Macbeth bursts forth naturally&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q>My dearest love</q>&mdash;</l>
</lg>

<p>
and shrinks from the boldness with which she presents
his own thoughts to him. With consummate
art she at first uses as incentives the very circumstances,
Duncan's coming to their house, &amp;c., which
Macbeth's conscience would most probably have
adduced to her as motives of abhorrence or repulsion.
Yet Macbeth is not prepared:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q>We will speak further.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Ib.</hi> sc. 6. The lyrical movement with which this
<pb n='238'/><anchor id='Pg238'/>
scene opens, and the free and unengaged mind of
Banquo, loving nature, and rewarded in the love
itself, form a highly dramatic contrast with the
laboured rhythm and hypocritical over-much of
Lady Macbeth's welcome, in which you cannot
detect a ray of personal feeling, but all is thrown
upon the <q>dignities,</q> the general duty.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Ib.</hi> sc. 7. Macbeth's speech:&mdash;

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Ib.</hi> sc. 2. Now that the deed is done or doing&mdash;now
that the first reality commences, Lady Macbeth
shrinks. The most simple sound strikes
terror, the most natural consequences are horrible,
whilst previously every thing, however awful,
appeared a mere trifle; conscience, which before
had been hidden to Macbeth in selfish and prudential
fears, now rushes in upon him in her own
veritable person:&mdash;
</p>

his few speeches afterwards, I believe to have been
written for the mob by some other hand, perhaps
with Shakespeare's consent; and that finding it
take, he with the remaining ink of a pen otherwise
employed, just interpolated the words&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend="display">

The deed is done; but Macbeth receives no

<hi rend='italic'>Ib.</hi> sc. 2. This scene, dreadful as it is, is still a
relief, because a variety, because domestic, and
therefore soothing, as associated with the only real
pleasures of life. The conversation between Lady
Macduff and her child heightens the pathos, and is
preparatory for the deep tragedy of their assassination.
Shakespeare's fondness for children is everywhere
shown;&mdash;in Prince Arthur, in <hi rend='italic'>King John</hi>;
in the sweet scene in the <hi rend='italic'>Winter's Tale</hi> between
Hermione and her son; nay, even in honest
Evans's examination of Mrs. Page's schoolboy.
To the objection that Shakespeare wounds the
moral sense by the unsubdued, undisguised
description of the most hateful atrocity&mdash;that he
tears the feelings without mercy, and even outrages
the eye itself with scenes of insupportable
horror&mdash;I, omitting <hi rend='italic'>Titus Andronicus</hi>, as not
genuine, and excepting the scene of Gloster's
blinding in <hi rend='italic'>Lear</hi>, answer boldly in the name of
Shakespeare, not guilty.

<p>
The moral is&mdash;the dreadful effects even on the
best minds of the soul-sickening sense of insecurity.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Ib.</hi> How admirably Macduff's grief is in harmony
with the whole play! It rends, not dissolves,
the heart. <q>The tune of it goes manly.</q> Thus
is Shakespeare always master of himself and of his
subject,&mdash;a genuine Proteus:&mdash;we see all things in
him, as images in a calm lake, most distinct, most
accurate,&mdash;only more splendid, more glorified.
This is correctness in the only philosophical sense.
But he requires your sympathy and your submission;
you must have that recipiency of moral
impression without which the purposes and ends
of the drama would be frustrated, and the absence
of which demonstrates an utter want of all imagination,
a deadness to that necessary pleasure of
being innocently&mdash;shall I say, deluded?&mdash;or
rather, drawn away from ourselves to the music of
noblest thought in harmonious sounds. Happy
he, who not only in the public theatre, but in the
labours of a profession, and round the light of his
own hearth, still carries a heart so pleasure-fraught!
</p>

<p>
Alas for Macbeth! now all is inward with him;
he has no more prudential prospective reasonings.
His wife, the only being who could have had any
seat in his affections, dies; he puts on despondency,
the final heart-armour of the wretched, and would
fain think every thing shadowy and unsubstantial,
as indeed all things are to those who cannot regard
them as symbols of goodness:&mdash;

<head><q>Winter's Tale.</q></head>

<p>
Although, on the whole, this play is exquisitely
respondent to its title, and even in the
fault I am about to mention, still a winter's tale;
yet it seems a mere indolence of the great bard not
to have provided in the oracular response (Act ii.
sc. 2.) some ground for Hermione's seeming death
and fifteen years' voluntary concealment. This
might have been easily effected by some obscure
sentence of the oracle, as for example:&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend="display">
<q><q>Nor shall he ever recover an heir, if he have a wife before
that recovery.</q></q>
</quote>

<p>
The idea of this delightful drama is a genuine
jealousy of disposition, and it should be immediately
followed by the perusal of <hi rend='italic'>Othello</hi>, which
is the direct contrast of it in every particular.
For jealousy is a vice of the mind, a culpable
tendency of the temper, having certain well-known
and well-defined effects and concomitants, all of
which are visible in Leontes, and, I boldly say, not
one of which marks its presence in Othello;&mdash;such
as, first, an excitability by the most inadequate
causes, and an eagerness to snatch at proofs;
secondly, a grossness of conception, and a disposition
to degrade the object of the passion by sensual
fancies and images; thirdly, a sense of shame of
his own feelings exhibited in a solitary moodiness
of humour, and yet from the violence of the passion
forced to utter itself, and therefore catching occasions
<pb n='244'/><anchor id='Pg244'/>
to ease the mind by ambiguities, equivoques,
by talking to those who cannot, and who are known
not to be able to, understand what is said to them,&mdash;in
short, by soliloquy in the form of dialogue,
and hence a confused, broken, and fragmentary,
manner; fourthly, a dread of vulgar ridicule, as
distinct from a high sense of honour, or a mistaken
sense of duty; and lastly, and immediately, consequent
on this, a spirit of selfish vindictiveness.
</p>

<p>
Act i. sc. 1, 2.&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Observe the easy style of chitchat between
Camillo and Archidamus as contrasted with the
elevated diction on the introduction of the kings
and Hermione in the second scene: and how
admirably Polixenes' obstinate refusal to Leontes
to stay,&mdash;

yielding to Hermione;&mdash;which is, nevertheless,
perfectly natural from mere courtesy of sex, and
the exhaustion of the will by former efforts of
denial, and well calculated to set in nascent action
the jealousy of Leontes. This, when once excited,
is unconsciously increased by Hermione,&mdash;

<p>
Act i. sc. 1.&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Admirable is the preparation, so truly and
peculiarly Shakespearian, in the introduction
of Roderigo, as the dupe on whom Iago shall first
exercise his art, and in so doing display his own
character. Roderigo, without any fixed principle,
but not without the moral notions and sympathies
with honour, which his rank and connections had
hung upon him, is already well fitted and predisposed
for the purpose; for very want of character
and strength of passion, like wind loudest in an
empty house, constitute his character. The first
three lines happily state the nature and foundation
of the friendship between him and Iago,&mdash;the
purse,&mdash;as also the contrast of Roderigo's intemperance
of mind with Iago's coolness,&mdash;the coolness
of a preconceiving experimenter. The mere
language of protestation,&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q>If ever I did dream of such a matter, abhor me,</q>&mdash;</l>
</lg>

<p>
which, falling in with the associative link, determines
Roderigo's continuation of complaint,&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q>Thou told'st me, thou didst hold him in thy hate,</q>&mdash;</l>
</lg>

<p>
elicits at length a true feeling of Iago's mind, the
dread of contempt habitual to those who encourage
in themselves, and have their keenest pleasure in,
the expression of contempt for others. Observe
Iago's high self-opinion, and the moral, that a
<pb n='248'/><anchor id='Pg248'/>
wicked man will employ real feelings, as well as
assume those most alien from his own, as instruments
of his purposes:&mdash;

the true one, as fitting to Iago's contempt for
whatever did not display power, and that intellectual
power. In what follows, let the reader
feel how by and through the glass of two passions,
disappointed vanity and envy, the very vices of
which he is complaining, are made to act upon
him as if they were so many excellences, and the
more appropriately, because cunning is always
admired and wished for by minds conscious of
inward weakness;&mdash;but they act only by half,
like music on an inattentive auditor, swelling the
thoughts which prevent him from listening to it.

<p>
Roderigo turns off to Othello; and here comes
one, if not the only, seeming justification of our
blackamoor or negro Othello. Even if we supposed
this an uninterrupted tradition of the
theatre, and that Shakespeare himself, from want
of scenes, and the experience that nothing could
be made too marked for the senses of his audience,
had practically sanctioned it,&mdash;would this prove
aught concerning his own intention as a poet for
all ages? Can we imagine him so utterly ignorant
as to make a barbarous negro plead royal birth,&mdash;at
a time, too, when negroes were not known
<pb n='249'/><anchor id='Pg249'/>
except as slaves? As for Iago's language to
Brabantio, it implies merely that Othello was a
Moor,&mdash;that is, black. Though I think the rivalry
of Roderigo sufficient to account for his wilful
confusion of Moor and Negro,&mdash;yet, even if compelled
to give this up, I should think it only
adapted for the acting of the day, and should
complain of an enormity built on a single word,
in direct contradiction to Iago's <q>Barbary horse.</q>
Besides, if we could in good earnest believe Shakespeare
ignorant of the distinction, still why should
we adopt one disagreeable possibility instead of a
ten times greater and more pleasing probability?
It is a common error to mistake the epithets
applied by the <hi rend='italic'>dramatis personæ</hi> to each other, as
truly descriptive of what the audience ought to
see or know. No doubt Desdemona saw Othello's
visage in his mind; yet, as we are constituted,
and most surely as an English audience was disposed
in the beginning of the seventeenth century,
it would be something monstrous to conceive this
beautiful Venetian girl falling in love with a veritable
negro. It would argue a disproportionateness,
a want of balance, in Desdemona, which Shakespeare
does not appear to have in the least contemplated.

on this ground.

<p>
The argument in Theobald's note, where <q>and

that Shakespeare could not use the same word
differently in different places; whereas I should
conclude, that as in the passage in <hi rend='italic'>Lear</hi> the word
is employed in its direct meaning, so here it is
used metaphorically; and this is confirmed by
what has escaped the editors, that it is not <q>I,</q>

the symbol of a petitioning inferior.

In real life, how do we look back to little
speeches as presentimental of, or contrasted with,
an affecting event! Even so, Shakespeare, as
secure of being read over and over, of becoming a
family friend, provides this passage for his readers,
and leaves it to them.

</p>

<lg>
<l><q>Virtue? a fig! 'tis in ourselves, that we are thus, or thus,</q> &amp;c.</l>
</lg>

<p>
This speech comprises the passionless character
of Iago. It is all will in intellect; and therefore
he is here a bold partizan of a truth, but yet of a
truth converted into a falsehood by the absence of
all the necessary modifications caused by the frail
nature of man. And then comes the last sentiment:&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend="display">
<q>Our raging motions, our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts,
whereof I take this, that you call&mdash;love, to be a sect or scion!</q>
</quote>

<p>
Here is the true Iagoism of, alas! how many!
Note Iago's pride of mastery in the repetition of
<q>Go, make money!</q> to his anticipated dupe,
even stronger than his love of lucre: and when
Roderigo is completely won,&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q>I am chang'd. I'll go sell all my land,</q>&mdash;</l>
</lg>

<p>
when the effect has been fully produced, the
repetition of triumph:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q>Go to; farewell; put money enough in your purse!</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
The remainder&mdash;Iago's soliloquy&mdash;the motive-hunting
of a motiveless malignity&mdash;how awful it
is! Yea, whilst he is still allowed to bear the
divine image, it is too fiendish for his own steady
view,&mdash;for the lonely gaze of a being next to
devil, and only not quite devil,&mdash;and yet a character
which Shakespeare has attempted and executed,
without disgust and without scandal!
</p>

<p>
Dr. Johnson has remarked that little or nothing
is wanting to render the <hi rend='italic'>Othello</hi> a regular tragedy,
but to have opened the play with the arrival of
Othello in Cyprus, and to have thrown the preceding
act into the form of narration. Here then
is the place to determine whether such a change
would or would not be an improvement;&mdash;nay
(to throw down the glove with a full challenge),
whether the tragedy would or not by such an
arrangement become more regular,&mdash;that is, more
consonant with the rules dictated by universal
reason, on the true common-sense of mankind, in
its application to the particular case. For in all
acts of judgment, it can never be too often recollected,
and scarcely too often repeated, that rules
are means to ends, and, consequently, that the end
must be determined and understood before it can
be known what the rules are or ought to be.
Now, from a certain species of drama, proposing
to itself the accomplishment of certain ends,&mdash;these
partly arising from the idea of the species
itself, but in part, likewise, forced upon the
dramatist by accidental circumstances beyond his
power to remove or control,&mdash;three rules have
been abstracted;&mdash;in other words, the means most
conducive to the attainment of the proposed ends
have been generalised, and prescribed under the
names of the three unities,&mdash;the unity of time, the
unity of place, and the unity of action&mdash;which
last would, perhaps, have been as appropriately,
as well as more intelligibly, entitled the unity of
interest. With this last the present question has
no immediate concern: in fact, its conjunction
with the former two is a mere delusion of words.
It is not properly a rule, but in itself the great
<pb n='253'/><anchor id='Pg253'/>
end not only of the drama, but of the epic poem,
the lyric ode, of all poetry, down to the candle-flame
cone of an epigram,&mdash;nay, of poesy in
general, as the proper generic term inclusive of
all the fine arts as its species. But of the unities
of time and place, which alone are entitled to the
name of rules, the history of their origin will be
their best criterion. You might take the Greek
chorus to a place, but you could not bring a place
to them without as palpable an equivoque as
bringing Birnam wood to Macbeth at Dunsinane.
It was the same, though in a less degree, with
regard to the unity of time:&mdash;the positive fact,
not for a moment removed from the senses, the
presence, I mean, of the same identical chorus,
was a continued measure of time;&mdash;and although
the imagination may supersede perception, yet it
must be granted to be an imperfection&mdash;however
easily tolerated&mdash;to place the two in broad contradiction
to each other. In truth, it is a mere
accident of terms; for the Trilogy of the Greek
theatre was a drama in three acts, and notwithstanding
this, what strange contrivances as to
place there are in the Aristophanic Frogs. Besides,
if the law of mere actual perception is once
violated&mdash;as it repeatedly is, even in the Greek
tragedies&mdash;why is it more difficult to imagine
three hours to be three years than to be a whole
day and night?

What any other man, who had learning enough,
might have quoted as a playful and witty illustration

woman!

</p>

<lg>
<l>... <q rend="pre">Of one, whose hand,</q></l>

<l><q rend="post">Richer than all his tribe,</q> &amp;c.</l>
</lg>

<p>
Theobald's note from Warburton.
</p>

<p>
Thus it is for no-poets to comment on the
greatest of poets! To make Othello say that he,
who had killed his wife, was like Herod who killed
Mariamne!&mdash;O, how many beauties, in this one
line, were impenetrable to the ever thought-swarming,
but idealess, Warburton! Othello
wishes to excuse himself on the score of ignorance,
and yet not to excuse himself,&mdash;to excuse himself
by accusing. This struggle of feeling is finely
conveyed in the word <q>base,</q> which is applied to
the rude Indian, not in his own character, but
as the momentary representative of Othello's.
<q>Indian</q>&mdash;for I retain the old reading&mdash;means
American, a savage <hi rend='italic'>in genere</hi>.
</p>

<p>
Finally, let me repeat that Othello does not kill
Desdemona in jealousy, but in a conviction forced
upon him by the almost superhuman art of Iago,
such a conviction as any man would and must
have entertained who had believed Iago's honesty
as Othello did. We, the audience, know that
Iago is a villain, from the beginning; but in considering
the essence of the Shakespearian Othello,
we must perseveringly place ourselves in his situation,
<pb n='257'/><anchor id='Pg257'/>
and under his circumstances. Then we shall
immediately feel the fundamental difference between
the solemn agony of the noble Moor, and
the wretched fishing jealousies of Leontes, and the
morbid suspiciousness of Leonatus, who is, in other
respects, a fine character. Othello had no life but
in Desdemona:&mdash;the belief that she, his angel, had
fallen from the heaven of her native innocence,
wrought a civil war in his heart. She is his
counterpart; and, like him, is almost sanctified in
our eyes by her absolute unsuspiciousness, and
holy entireness of love. As the curtain drops,
which do we pity the most?
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Extremum hunc</hi>&mdash;&mdash;. There are three
powers:&mdash;Wit, which discovers partial likeness
hidden in general diversity; subtlety, which discovers
the diversity concealed in general apparent
sameness;&mdash;and profundity, which discovers an
essential unity under all the semblances of
difference.
</p>

<p>
Give to a subtle man fancy, and he is a wit; to
a deep man imagination, and he is a philosopher.
Add, again, pleasurable sensibility in the threefold
form of sympathy with the interesting in morals,
the impressive in form, and the harmonious in
sound,&mdash;and you have the poet.
</p>

<p>
But combine all,&mdash;wit, subtlety, and fancy, with
profundity, imagination, and moral and physical
susceptibility of the pleasurable,&mdash;and let the
object of action be man universal; and we shall
have&mdash;O, rash prophecy! say, rather, we have&mdash;a

<head>Notes on Ben Jonson.</head>

<p>
It would be amusing to collect out of our dramatists
from Elizabeth to Charles I. proofs of
the manners of the times. One striking symptom
of general coarseness of manners, which may co-exist
with great refinement of morals, as, alas!
<hi rend='italic'>vice versa</hi>, is to be seen in the very frequent allusions
to the olfactories with their most disgusting
stimulants, and these, too, in the conversation of
virtuous ladies. This would not appear so strange
to one who had been on terms of familiarity with
Sicilian and Italian women of rank: and bad as
they may, too many of them, actually be, yet I
doubt not that the extreme grossness of their
language has impressed many an Englishman of
the present era with far darker notions than the
same language would have produced in the mind
of one of Elizabeth's or James's courtiers. Those
who have read Shakespeare only, complain of
occasional grossness in his plays; but compare
him with his contemporaries, and the inevitable
conviction, is that of the exquisite purity of his
imagination.
</p>

<p>
The observation I have prefixed to the <hi rend='italic'>Volpone</hi>
is the key to the faint interest which these noble
efforts of intellectual power excite, with the
exception of the fragment of the <hi rend='italic'>Sad Shepherd</hi>;
because in that piece only is there any character
with whom you can morally sympathise. On the
<pb n='262'/><anchor id='Pg262'/>
other hand, <hi rend='italic'>Measure for Measure</hi> is the only play
of Shakespeare's in which there are not some one
or more characters, generally many, whom you
follow with affectionate feeling. For I confess that
Isabella, of all Shakespeare's female characters,
pleases me the least; and <hi rend='italic'>Measure for Measure</hi> is,
indeed, the only one of his genuine works, which
is painful to me.
</p>

<p>
Let me not conclude this remark, however,
without a thankful acknowledgment to the <hi rend='italic'>manes</hi>
of Ben Jonson, that the more I study his writings,
I the more admire them; and the more my study
of him resembles that of an ancient classic, in the
<hi rend='italic'>minutiæ</hi> of his rhythm, metre, choice of words,
forms of connection, and so forth, the more
numerous have the points of my admiration
become. I may add, too, that both the study and
the admiration cannot but be disinterested, for to
expect therefrom any advantage to the present
drama would be ignorance. The latter is utterly
heterogeneous from the drama of the Shakespearian
age, with a diverse object and contrary principle.
The one was to present a model by imitation of
real life, taking from real life all that in it which
it ought to be, and supplying the rest;&mdash;the other
is to copy what is, and as it is,&mdash;at best a tolerable
but most frequently a blundering, copy. In the
former the difference was an essential element; in
the latter an involuntary defect. We should think
it strange, if a tale in dance were announced, and
the actors did not dance at all;&mdash;and yet such is
modern comedy.

<head>Whalley's Preface.</head>

<quote rend="display">
<q>But Jonson was soon sensible, how inconsistent this medley of
names and manners was in reason and nature; and with how little
propriety it could ever have a place in a legitimate and just picture
of real life.</q>
</quote>

<p>
But did Jonson reflect that the very essence of
a play, the very language in which it is
written, is a fiction to which all the parts must
conform? Surely, Greek manners in English
should be a still grosser improbability than a
Greek name transferred to English manners. Ben's
<hi rend='italic'>personæ</hi> are too often not characters, but derangements;&mdash;the
hopeless patients of a mad-doctor
rather,&mdash;exhibitions of folly betraying itself in
spite of exciting reason and prudence. He not
poetically, but painfully exaggerates every trait;
that is, not by the drollery of the circumstance,
but by the excess of the originating feeling.
</p>

<quote rend="display">
<q>But to this we might reply, that far from being thought to
build his characters upon abstract ideas, he was really accused of
representing particular persons then existing; and that even those
characters which appear to be the most exaggerated, are said to
have had their respective archetypes in nature and life.</q>
</quote>

<p>
This degrades Jonson into a libeller, instead of
justifying him as a dramatic poet. <hi rend='italic'>Non quod
verum est, sed quod verisimile</hi>, is the dramatist's
rule. At all events, the poet who chooses transitory
manners, ought to content himself with transitory
praise. If his object be reputation, he ought
not to expect fame. The utmost he can look forwards
to, is to be quoted by, and to enliven the
<pb n='264'/><anchor id='Pg264'/>
writings of, an antiquarian. Pistol, Nym, and <hi rend='italic'>id
genus omne</hi>, do not please us as characters, but are
endured as fantastic creations, foils to the native
wit of Falstaff.&mdash;I say wit emphatically; for this
character so often extolled as the masterpiece of
humour, neither contains, nor was meant to contain,
any humour at all.

I have often thought Shakespeare justified in
this seeming anachronism. In Pagan times
a single name of a German kingdom might well
be supposed to comprise a hundred miles more
than at present. The truth is, these notes of
Drummond's are more disgraceful to himself than
to Jonson. It would be easy to conjecture how
grossly Jonson must have been misunderstood,
and what he had said in jest, as of Hippocrates,
interpreted in earnest. But this is characteristic
of a Scotchman; he has no notion of a jest, unless
you tell him&mdash;<q>This is a joke!</q>&mdash;and still less of
that finer shade of feeling, the half-and-half, in
which Englishmen naturally delight.

<p>
The anachronic mixture in this Arruntius of
the Roman republican, to whom Tiberius
must have appeared as much a tyrant as Sejanus,
with his James-and-Charles-the-First zeal for
legitimacy of descent in this passage, is amusing.
Of our great names Milton was, I think, the first
who could properly be called a republican. My
recollections of Buchanan's works are too faint to
enable me to judge whether the historian is not a
fair exception.
</p>

</lg>

<p>
The more we reflect and examine, examine and
reflect, the more astonished shall we be at the
immense superiority of Shakespeare over his contemporaries;&mdash;and
<pb n='269'/><anchor id='Pg269'/>
yet what contemporaries!&mdash;giant
minds indeed! Think of Jonson's erudition,
and the force of learned authority in that age;
and yet, in no genuine part of Shakespeare's works
is there to be found such an absurd rant and
ventriloquism as this, and too, too many other
passages ferruminated by Jonson from Seneca's
tragedies, and the writings of the later Romans.
I call it ventriloquism, because Sejanus is a
puppet, out of which the poet makes his own
voice appear to come.
</p>

<p>
Act v. Scene of the sacrifice to Fortune.
</p>

<p>
This scene is unspeakably irrational. To believe,
and yet to scoff at, a present miracle is
little less than impossible. Sejanus should have
been made to suspect priestcraft and a secret
conspiracy against him.

<head><q>Volpone.</q></head>

<p>
This admirable, indeed, but yet more wonderful
than admirable, play is, from the fertility and
vigour of invention, character, language, and
sentiment, the strongest proof how impossible it is
to keep up any pleasurable interest in a tale, in
which there is no goodness of heart in any of the
prominent characters. After the third act, this
play becomes not a dead, but a painful, weight on
the feelings. <hi rend='italic'>Zeluco</hi> is an instance of the same
truth. Bonario and Celia should have been made
in some way or other principals in the plot; which
they might have been, and the objects of interest,
without having been made characters. In novels,
the person in whose fate you are most interested,
is often the least marked character of the whole.
If it were possible to lessen the paramountcy of
Volpone himself, a most delightful comedy might
be produced, by making Celia the ward or niece
of Corvino, instead of his wife, and Bonario her
lover.

<pb n='272'/><anchor id='Pg272'/>

<p>
Whalley's note at the end:&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend="display">
<q>Some critics of the last age imagined the character of Morose
to be wholly out of nature. But to vindicate our poet, Mr. Dryden
tells us from tradition, and we may venture to take his word, that
Jonson was really acquainted with a person of this whimsical turn
of mind: and as humour is a personal quality, the poet is acquitted
from the charge of exhibiting a monster, or an extravagant unnatural
<hi rend='italic'>caricatura</hi>.</q>
</quote>

<p>
If Dryden had not made all additional proof
superfluous by his own plays, this very vindication
would evince that he had formed a false and
vulgar conception of the nature and conditions of
drama and dramatic personation. Ben Jonson
would himself have rejected such a plea:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">For he knew, poet never credit gain'd</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">By writing <emph>truths</emph>, but things, like truths,
well feign'd.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
By <q>truths</q> he means <q>facts.</q> Caricatures are
not less so because they are found existing in real
life. Comedy demands characters, and leaves
caricatures to farce. The safest and the truest
defence of old Ben would be to call the <hi rend='italic'>Epicœne</hi>
the best of farces. The defect in Morose, as in
other of Jonson's <hi rend='italic'>dramatis personæ</hi>, lies in this;&mdash;that
the accident is not a prominence growing out
of, and nourished by, the character which still
circulates in it; but that the character, such as it
is, rises out of, or, rather, consists in, the accident.
Shakespeare's comic personages have exquisitely
characteristic features; however awry, disproportionate,
and laughable they may be, still, like
Bardolph's nose, they are features. But Jonson's
are either a man with a huge wen, having a circulation
of its own, and which we might conceive
amputated, and the patient thereby losing all his
character; or they are mere wens themselves
<pb n='273'/><anchor id='Pg273'/>
instead of men,&mdash;wens personified, or with eyes,
nose, and mouth cut out, mandrake-fashion.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Nota bene.</hi>&mdash;All the above, and much more,
will have justly been said, if, and whenever, the
drama of Jonson is brought into comparisons of
rivalry with the Shakespearian. But this should
not be. Let its inferiority to the Shakespearian
be at once fairly owned,&mdash;but at the same time as
the inferiority of an altogether different <hi rend='italic'>genius</hi> of
the drama. On this ground, old Ben would still
maintain his proud height. He, no less than
Shakespeare stands on the summit of his hill, and
looks round him like a master,&mdash;though his be
Lattrig and Shakespeare's Skiddaw.

A fondness for judging one work by comparison

chiefly on this principle that the <hi rend='italic'>Catiline</hi> has been
rated so low. Take it and <hi rend='italic'>Sejanus</hi>, as compositions
of a particular kind, namely, as a mode of relating
great historical events in the liveliest and most
interesting manner, and I cannot help wishing
that we had whole volumes of such plays. We
might as rationally expect the excitement of the
<hi rend='italic'>Vicar of Wakefield</hi> from Goldsmith's <hi rend='italic'>History of

The best excuse that can be made for Jonson,
and in a somewhat less degree for Beaumont
and Fletcher, in respect of these base and silly
sneers at Shakespeare is, that his plays were
present to men's minds chiefly as acted. They
had not a neat edition of them, as we have, so as,
by comparing the one with the other, to form a
just notion of the mighty mind that produced the
whole. At all events, and in every point of view,
Jonson stands far higher in a moral light than
Beaumont and Fletcher. He was a fair contemporary,
and in his way, and as far as Shakespeare
is concerned, an original. But Beaumont and
Fletcher were always imitators of, and often
borrowers from him, and yet sneer at him with a
spite far more malignant than Jonson, who,
besides, has made noble compensation by his
praises.

Jonson has elsewhere proceeded thus far; but
the part most difficult and delicate, yet, perhaps,
not the least capable of being both morally and
poetically treated, is the union itself, and what,
even in this life, it can be.

<head>Harris's Commendatory Poem On Fletcher.</head>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">I'd have a state of wit convok'd, which hath</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">A <emph>power</emph> to take up on common faith:</q>&mdash;</l>
</lg>

<p>
This is an instance of that modifying of
quantity by emphasis, without which our
elder poets cannot be scanned. <q>Power,</q> here,
instead of being one long syllable&mdash;pow'r&mdash;must
be sounded, not indeed as a spondee, nor yet as a
trochee; but as - u u;&mdash;the first syllable is 1-1/4.
</p>

<p>
We can, indeed, never expect an authentic
edition of our elder dramatic poets (for in those
times a drama was a poem), until some man undertakes
the work, who has studied the philosophy of
metre. This has been found the main torch of
sound restoration in the Greek dramatists by
Bentley, Porson, and their followers;&mdash;how much
more, then, in writers in our own language! It
is true that quantity, an almost iron law with the
Greek, is in English rather a subject for a peculiarly
fine ear, than any law or even rule; but,
then, instead of it, we have, first, accent; secondly,
emphasis; and lastly, retardation, and acceleration
of the times of syllables according to the meaning
of the words, the passion that accompanies them,
and even the character of the person that uses
them. With due attention to these,&mdash;above all,
to that, which requires the most attention and the
finest taste, the character, Massinger, for example,
might be reduced to a rich and yet regular metre.
<pb n='288'/><anchor id='Pg288'/>
But then the <hi rend='italic'>regulæ</hi> must be first known; though
I will venture to say, that he who does not find a
line (not corrupted) of Massinger's flow to the time
total of a trimeter catalectic iambic verse, has not
read it aright. But by virtue of the last principle&mdash;the
retardation of acceleration of time&mdash;we
have the proceleusmatic foot u u u u, and the <hi rend='italic'>dispondæus</hi>
- - - -, not to mention the <hi rend='italic'>choriambus</hi>, the
ionics, pæons, and epitrites. Since Dryden, the
metre of our poets leads to the sense; in our elder
and more genuine bards, the sense, including the
passion, leads to the metre. Read even Donne's
satires as he meant them to be read, and as the
sense and passion demand, and you will find in the
lines a manly harmony.

Seward's note and suggestion of <q>in.</q>
</p>

<p>
It would be amusing to learn from some
existing friend of Mr. Seward what he meant, or
rather dreamed, in this note. It is certainly a
difficult passage, of which there are two solutions;&mdash;one,
that the writer was somewhat more injudicious
than usual;&mdash;the other, that he was very,
very much more profound and Shakespearian than
usual. Seward's emendation, at all events, is right
and obvious. Were it a passage of Shakespeare, I
should not hesitate to interpret it as characteristic
of Tigranes' state of mind, disliking the very
virtues, and therefore half-consciously representing
them as mere products of the violence of the sex
in general in all their whims, and yet forced to
admire, and to feel and to express gratitude for,
the exertion in his own instance. The inconsistency
of the passage would be the consistency of the
author. But this is above Beaumont and Fletcher.

<head><q>The Custom Of The Country.</q></head>

<p>
I cannot but think that in a country conquered
by a nobler race than the natives, and
in which the latter became villeins and bondsmen,
this custom, <hi rend='italic'>lex merchetæ</hi>, may have been introduced
for wise purposes,&mdash;as of improving the
breed, lessening the antipathy of different races,
and producing a new bond of relationship between
the lord and the tenant, who, as the eldest born,
would at least have a chance of being, and a probability
of being thought, the lord's child. In
the West Indies it cannot have these effects,
because the mulatto is marked by nature different
from the father, and because there is no bond, no
law, no custom, but of mere debauchery.&mdash;1815.

</p>

<lg>
<l><q>Yet if you play not fair play,</q> &amp;c.</l>

Evidently to be transposed, and read thus:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">Yet if you play not fair, above-board too,</q></l>

<l>I've a foolish engine here:&mdash;I say no more&mdash;</l>
<l><q rend="post">But if your Honour's guts are not enchanted.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
Licentious as the comic metre of B. and F. is,&mdash;a
far more lawless, and yet far less happy, imitation
of the rhythm of animated talk in real life than
Massinger's&mdash;still it is made worse than it really
is by ignorance of the halves, thirds, and two-thirds
of a line which B. and F. adopted from the
<pb n='294'/><anchor id='Pg294'/>
Italian and Spanish dramatists. Thus, in Rutilio's
speech:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">Though I confess</q></l>
<l><q rend="post">Any man would desire to have her, and by any means,</q> &amp;c.</l>
</lg>

<p>
Correct the whole passage,&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">Though I confess</q></l>
<l>Any man would</l>
<l>Desire to have her, and by any means,</l>
<l>At any rate too, yet this common hangman</l>
<l>That hath whipt off a thousănd măids heads already&mdash;</l>
<l><q rend="post">That he should glean the harvest, sticks in my stomach!</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
In all comic metres the gulping of short syllables,
and the abbreviation of syllables ordinarily long
by the rapid pronunciation of eagerness and vehemence,
are not so much a license as a law,&mdash;a
faithful copy of nature, and let them be read
characteristically, the times will be found nearly
equal. Thus, the three words marked above make
a <hi rend='italic'>choriambus</hi> -- u u,
or perhaps a <hi rend='italic'>pæon primus</hi> - u u u;
a dactyl, by virtue of comic rapidity,
being only equal to an iambus when distinctly
pronounced. I have no doubt that all B. and F.'s
works might be safely corrected by attention to
this rule, and that the editor is entitled to transpositions
of all kinds, and to not a few omissions.
For the rule of the metre once lost&mdash;what was to
restrain the actors from interpolation?

Colman's note on Seward's attempt to put this
play into metre.
</p>

<p>
The editors, and their contemporaries in general,
were ignorant of any but the regular iambic verse.
A study of the Aristophanic and Plautine metres
would have enabled them to reduce B. and F.
throughout into metre, except where prose is
really intended.

<head><q>The Loyal Subject.</q></head>

<p>
It is well worthy of notice, and yet has not been,
I believe, noticed hitherto, what a marked
difference there exists in the dramatic writers of
the Elizabetho-Jacobæan age&mdash;(Mercy on me!
what a phrase for <q>the writers during the reigns
of Elizabeth and James I.!</q>)&mdash;in respect of their
political opinions. Shakespeare, in this, as in all
other things, himself and alone, gives the permanent
politics of human nature, and the only
predilection which appears, shows itself in his
contempt of mobs and the populacy. Massinger
is a decided Whig;&mdash;Beaumont and Fletcher high-flying,
passive-obedience, Tories. The Spanish
dramatists furnished them with this, as with
many other ingredients. By the by, an accurate
and familiar acquaintance with all the productions
of the Spanish stage previously to 1620, is an
indispensable qualification for an editor of B. and
F.;&mdash;and with this qualification a most interesting
and instructive edition might be given. This
edition of Colman's (Stockdale, 1811) is below
criticism.
</p>

<p>
In metre, B. and F. are inferior to Shakespeare,
on the one hand, as expressing the poetic part of
the drama, and to Massinger, on the other, in the
art of reconciling metre with the natural rhythm
of conversation,&mdash;in which, indeed, Massinger is
<pb n='302'/><anchor id='Pg302'/>
unrivalled. Read him aright, and measure by
time, not syllables, and no lines can be more legitimate,&mdash;none
in which the substitution of equipollent
feet, and the modifications by emphasis,
are managed with such exquisite judgment. B.
and F. are fond of the twelve syllable (not
Alexandrine) line, as:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q>Too many fears 'tis thought too: and to nourish those.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
This has often a good effect, and is one of the
varieties most common in Shakespeare.

Mr. Seward had his brains out. The humour

The poet intended no allusion to the word

<p>
Act i. sc. 3.&mdash;
</p>

<p>
It is a real trial of charity to read this scene
with tolerable temper towards Fletcher. So
very slavish&mdash;so reptile&mdash;are the feelings and
sentiments represented as duties. And yet, remember,
he was a bishop's son, and the duty to
God was the supposed basis.
</p>

<p>
Personals, including body, house, home, and
religion;&mdash;property, subordination, and inter-community;&mdash;these
are the fundamentals of
society. I mean here, religion negatively taken,&mdash;so
that the person be not compelled to do or
utter, in relation of the soul to God, what would
be, in that person, a lie;&mdash;such as to force a man
to go to church, or to swear that he believes what
he does not believe. Religion, positively taken,
may be a great and useful privilege, but cannot
be a right,&mdash;were it for this only, that it cannot
be pre-defined. The ground of this distinction
between negative and positive religion, as a social
right, is plain. No one of my fellow-citizens is
encroached on by my not declaring to him what I
believe respecting the super-sensual; but should
every man be entitled to preach against the
preacher, who could hear any preacher? Now,
it is different in respect of loyalty. There we
have positive rights, but not negative rights;&mdash;for
every pretended negative would be in effect a
positive;&mdash;as if a soldier had a right to keep to
<pb n='307'/><anchor id='Pg307'/>
himself whether he would, or would not, fight.
Now, no one of these fundamentals can be rightfully
attacked, except when the guardian of it has
abused it to subvert one or more of the rest. The
reason is, that the guardian, as a fluent, is less
than the permanent which he is to guard. He is
the temporary and mutable mean, and derives his
whole value from the end. In short, as robbery
is not high treason, so neither is every unjust act
of a king the converse. All must be attacked and
endangered. Why? Because the king, as <hi rend='italic'>a</hi> to A,
is a mean to A, or subordination, in a far higher
sense than a proprietor, as <hi rend='italic'>b</hi> to A, is a mean to B,
or property.

prior editions,&mdash;irremediable but by bold conjecture.
<q><emph>Till</emph> my tackle,</q> should be, I think,
<q><emph>While</emph>,</q> &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
Act iii. sc. 1. B. and F. always write as if
virtue or goodness were a sort of talisman, or
strange something, that might be lost without the
least fault on the part of the owner. In short,
their chaste ladies value their chastity as a material
thing,&mdash;not as an act or state of being; and
this mere thing being imaginary, no wonder that
all their women are represented with the minds of
strumpets, except a few irrational humourists, far
less capable of exciting our sympathy than a
Hindoo who has had a basin of cow-broth thrown
over him;&mdash;for this, though a debasing superstition,
is still real, and we might pity the poor
<pb n='308'/><anchor id='Pg308'/>
wretch, though we cannot help despising him.
But B. and F.'s Lucinas are clumsy fictions. It
is too plain that the authors had no one idea of
chastity as a virtue, but only such a conception as
a blind man might have of the power of seeing by
handling an ox's eye. In <hi rend='italic'>The Queen of Corinth</hi>,
indeed, they talk differently; but it is all talk,
and nothing is real in it but the dread of losing a
reputation. Hence the frightful contrast between
their women (even those who are meant for virtuous)
and Shakespeare's. So, for instance, <hi rend='italic'>The
Maid in the Mill</hi>:&mdash;a woman must not merely have
grown old in brothels, but have chuckled over
every abomination committed in them with a
rampant sympathy of imagination, to have had
her fancy so drunk with the <hi rend='italic'>minutiæ</hi> of lechery as
this icy chaste virgin evinces hers to have been.
</p>

<p>
It would be worth while to note how many of
these plays are founded on rapes,&mdash;how many on
incestuous passions, and how many on mere lunacies.
Then their virtuous women are either crazy
superstitions of a mere bodily negation of having
been acted on, or strumpets in their imaginations
and wishes, or, as in this <hi rend='italic'>Maid in the Mill</hi>, both at
the same time. In the men, the love is merely
lust in one direction,&mdash;exclusive preference of one
object. The tyrant's speeches are mostly taken
from the mouths of indignant denouncers of the
tyrant's character, with the substitution of <q>I</q>
for <q>he,</q>" and the omission of the prefatory <q>he
acts as if he thought</q> so and so. The only feelings
they can possibly excite are disgust at the
Æciuses, if regarded as sane loyalists, or compassion
if considered as Bedlamites. So much for
their tragedies. But even their comedies are,
<pb n='309'/><anchor id='Pg309'/>
most of them, disturbed by the fantasticalness, or
gross caricature, of the persons or incidents. There
are few characters that you can really like (even
though you should have erased from your mind
all the filth which bespatters the most likeable of
them, as Piniero in <hi rend='italic'>The Island Princess</hi>
for instance),&mdash;scarcely
one whom you can love. How
different this from Shakespeare, who makes one
have a sort of sneaking affection even for his
Barnardines;&mdash;whose very Iagos and Richards
are awful, and, by the counteracting power of
profound intellects, rendered fearful rather than
hateful;&mdash;and even the exceptions, as Goneril and
Regan, are proofs of superlative judgment and the
finest moral tact, in being left utter monsters,
<hi rend='italic'>nulla virtute redemptæ</hi>, and in being kept out of
sight as much as possible,&mdash;they being, indeed,
only means for the excitement and deepening of
noblest emotions towards the Lear, Cordelia, &amp;c.
and employed with the severest economy! But
even Shakespeare's grossness&mdash;that which is really
so, independently of the increase in modern times
of vicious associations with things indifferent (for
there is a state of manners conceivable so pure,
that the language of Hamlet at Ophelia's feet
might be a harmless rallying, or playful teazing,
of a shame that would exist in Paradise)&mdash;at the
worst, how diverse in kind is it from Beaumont
and Fletcher's! In Shakespeare it is the mere
generalities of sex, mere words for the most
part, seldom or never distinct images, all head-work,
and fancy drolleries; there is no sensation
supposed in the speaker. I need not proceed to
contrast this with B. and F.

<p>
This, perhaps, the most energetic of Fletcher's
tragedies. He evidently aimed at a new
Richard III. in Rollo;&mdash;but, as in all his other
imitations of Shakespeare, he was not philosopher
enough to bottom his original. Thus, in Rollo, he
has produced a mere personification of outrageous
wickedness, with no fundamental characteristic
impulses to make either the tyrant's words or
actions philosophically intelligible. Hence the
most pathetic situations border on the horrible,
and what he meant for the terrible, is either
hateful, τὸ μισητὸν, or ludicrous. The scene of
Baldwin's sentence in the third act is probably
the grandest working of passion in all B. and F.'s
dramas;&mdash;but the very magnificence of filial affection
given to Edith, in this noble scene, renders
the after scene (in imitation of one of the least
Shakespearian of all Shakespeare's works, if it be
his, the scene between Richard and Lady Anne)
in which Edith is yielding to a few words and
tears, not only unnatural, but disgusting. In
Shakespeare, Lady Anne is described as a weak,
vain, very woman throughout.

<p>
This character of Aubrey, and the whole spirit
of this and several other plays of the same authors,
<pb n='311'/><anchor id='Pg311'/>
are interesting as traits of the morals which it was
fashionable to teach in the reigns of James I. and
his successor, who died a martyr to them. Stage,
pulpit, law, fashion,&mdash;all conspired to enslave the
realm. Massinger's plays breathe the opposite
spirit; Shakespeare's the spirit of wisdom which is
for all ages. By the by, the Spanish dramatists&mdash;Calderon,
in particular,&mdash;had some influence in
this respect, of romantic loyalty to the greatest
monsters, as well as in the busy intrigues of B.
and F.'s plays.

</p>

<p>
In respect of style and versification, this play and
the following of <hi rend='italic'>Bonduca</hi> may be taken as the best,
and yet as characteristic, specimens of Beaumont
and Fletcher's dramas. I particularly instance
the first scene of the <hi rend='italic'>Bonduca</hi>. Take Shakespeare's
<hi rend='italic'>Richard II.</hi>, and having selected some one scene of
about the same number of lines, and consisting
mostly of long speeches, compare it with the first
scene in <hi rend='italic'>Bonduca</hi>,&mdash;not for the idle purpose of
finding out which is the better, but in order to see
and understand the difference. The latter, that of
B. and F., you will find a well-arranged bed of
flowers, each having its separate root, and its
position determined aforehand by the will of the
gardener,&mdash;each fresh plant a fresh volition. In
the former you see an Indian fig-tree, as described
by Milton;&mdash;all is growth, evolution;&mdash;each
line, each word almost, begets the following,
and the will of the writer is an interfusion, a
continuous agency, and not a series of separate

depth of Genius: Beaumont and Fletcher the
excellent mechanism, in juxta-position and succession,
of talent.

<head><q>The Noble Gentleman.</q></head>

<p>
Why have the dramatists of the times of
Elizabeth, James I., and the first Charles
become almost obsolete, with the exception of
Shakespeare? Why do they no longer belong to
the English, being once so popular? And why is
Shakespeare an exception?&mdash;One thing, among
fifty, necessary to the full solution is, that they all
employed poetry and poetic diction on unpoetic
subjects, both characters and situations, especially
in their comedy. Now Shakespeare is all, all ideal,&mdash;of
no time, and therefore for all times. Read,
for instance, Marine's panegyric in the first scene
of this play:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 10">... <q rend="pre">Know</q></l>
<l>The eminent court, to them that can be wise,</l>
<l><q rend="post">And fasten on her blessings, is a sun,</q> &amp;c.</l>
</lg>

<p>
What can be more unnatural and inappropriate
(not only is, but must be felt as such) than such
poetry in the mouth of a silly dupe? In short,
the scenes are mock dialogues, in which the poet
<hi rend='italic'>solus</hi> plays the ventriloquist, but cannot keep down
his own way of expressing himself. Heavy complaints
have been made respecting the transposing
of the old plays by Cibber; but it never occurred
to these critics to ask, how it came that no one
ever attempted to transpose a comedy of Shakespeare's.

Act i. Oldcraft's speech:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q>I'm arm'd at all points,</q> &amp;c.</l>
</lg>

<p>
It would be very easy to restore all this passage
to metre, by supplying a sentence of four
syllables, which the reasoning almost demands,
and by correcting the grammar. Read thus:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="pre">Arm'd at all points 'gainst treachery, I hold</q></l>
<l>My humour firm. If, living, I can see thee</l>
<l>Thrive by thy wits, I shall have the more courage,</l>
<l>Dying, to trust thee with my lands. If not,</l>
<l>The best wit, I can hear of, carries them.</l>
<l>For since so many in my time and knowledge,</l>
<l>Rich children of the city, have concluded</l>
<l><emph>For lack of wit</emph> in beggary, I'd rather</l>
<l>Make a wise stranger my executor,</l>
<l>Than a fool son my heir, and have my lands call'd</l>
<l><q rend="post">After my wit than name: and that's my nature!</q></l>

<p>
In this (as, indeed, in all other respects, but
most in this) it is that Shakespeare is so incomparably
superior to Fletcher and his friend,&mdash;in
judgment! What can be conceived more unnatural
and motiveless than this brutal resolve?
How is it possible to feel the least interest in
Albertus afterwards? or in Cesario after his
conduct?

<head><q>The Two Noble Kinsmen.</q></head>

<p>
On comparing the prison scene of <hi rend='italic'>Palamon and
Arcite</hi>, act ii. sc. 2, with the dialogue between
the same speakers, act i. sc. 2, I can
scarcely retain a doubt as to the first act's having
been written by Shakespeare. Assuredly it was
not written by B. and F. I hold Jonson more
probable than either of these two.
</p>

<p>
The main presumption, however, for Shakespeare's
share in this play rests on a point, to
which the sturdy critics of this edition (and indeed
all before them) were blind,&mdash;that is, the construction
of the blank verse, which proves beyond all
doubt an intentional imitation, if not the proper
hand, of Shakespeare. Now, whatever improbability
<pb n='318'/><anchor id='Pg318'/>
there is in the former (which supposes
Fletcher conscious of the inferiority, the too
poematic <hi rend='italic'>minus</hi>-dramatic nature of his versification,
and of which, there is neither proof nor likelihood)
adds so much to the probability of the
latter. On the other hand, the harshness of
many of these very passages, a harshness unrelieved
by any lyrical inter-breathings, and still
more the want of profundity in the thoughts, keep
me from an absolute decision.
</p>

<p>
Act i. sc. 3. Emilia's speech:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 10">... <q rend="pre">Since his depart, his
<emph>sports</emph></q>,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Tho' craving seriousness and skill,</q> &amp;c.</l>
</lg>

<p>
I conjecture <q>imports,</q>&mdash;that is, duties or offices
of importance. The flow of the versification in
this speech seems to demand the trochaic ending - u;
while the text blends jingle and <emph>hisses</emph> to
the annoyance of less sensitive ears than Fletcher's&mdash;not
to say, Shakespeare's.

<p>
Act i. sc. 2.&mdash;
</p>

<p>
This scene from the beginning is prose printed
as blank verse, down to the line&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><q>E'en all the valiant stomachs in the court</q>&mdash;</l>
</lg>

<p>
where the verse recommences. This transition
from the prose to the verse enhances, and indeed
forms the comic effect. Lazarillo concludes his
soliloquy with a hymn to the goddess of plenty.
</p>

<p>
THE END.
